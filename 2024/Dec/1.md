Just a couple more nights it'll be back home, and I've been thinking a lot about future life with wife and such. At least that's how Aunt Patty and everyone else sees it lol. She's only the second woman I've been with, but damn is it better by a landslide than that first one in bed.

I know there are these kinds of taboos and such, not to mention social responsibility around talking about the sexes like this. I have been especially thinking about the "role" women used to play in societies much more planned out by men, seemingly too often to minimize any resistance to complete dominance by men (and thus easy sexual access). That sounds kinda weird, but I think the viewpoint makes sense in the dated perspective of men doing most of society's work while the woman is by and large a cheerleader from the home ed. POV.

I totally get that there are a lot of people who are females that don't fall into that categorization today, by means of a unique uprising or another factor. But thankfully K certainly falls into the former group as discussed and known in re just wanting to be a stay-at-home mom. And I think that's pretty fucking hot because what's the point of having two people work when one of them is a billionaire, like that's just stupid.

Anyway it's been an on and off thing for me debating between all the paths that could have been, and particularly all the women I ignored after starting to date Kayla and such. I recall this one girl who was a petite blonde with some fairly humorous braces, she just wouldn't stop trying to take me out at Tech. Frankly quite a few like that, and yet I am so very presently thankful for the clarity and focus emergent in my steadfast path down this one relationship.

Perhaps there is always a natural "beta" tendency to look back at paths not taken, to wonder if perhaps just one splinter a ways back would yield some materially different present reality. But to live like that would be embracing comprehensive wishy-washy indeterminism, which ultimately leads to a life of squalor and irrelevant averageness. And ofc that's not a path worth adventuring down, compared to my present and impassioned missionary trailblaze.

It was humorous for me to compare this ethos, so vehemently shamed by Brunson, with his singular statement of finding your wife in college, to all other ends. I wonder how his relationship will manage in a small sense, but by and large I see a prudent and happy family with nothing but the greatest joys coming up ahead. When considering my life's timeframe, that can get to my head quite easily.

To think that I will certainly outlive K makes me wonder about the phase to follow, alongside the number of kin I enjoy and leave. I always thought lots of kids, at least 7, in an effort to personally give my all to spreading abundance. But K only wants 2 or 3, which is interesting given I will have so much time after her should I want to procreate further later.

It's quite thoughtfulsome to consider K's claimed early childhood developments (I'm just not familiar enough with how all that works) and how it could lead to her primitive lack of fertility and thus demise by hormonal selection, if I understand the science correctly. And thus I'm left with these questioning future insights as to both my immediate familiar plans and ofc later pleasures. Much of this stemmed from watching _Pretty Woman_ for the first time with Mom and Aunt P the last night; seeing so clearly the impact a wealthy life which I will soon achieve might have on the average woman of sorts.

That's one thing I absolutely love about K, that I know it by and large will be the only relationship I enjoy which is provably not engrossed in monetary interests, as can so commonly corrupt the bonds between a man and a woman. The lack of marriage from Musk rings true to these observations on a surface level. I just know that right now I need stability in quite a few ways, as I've enjoyed for years from her, and ideally that can continue transforming me into my most productive self at any ego-indulgent cost.
