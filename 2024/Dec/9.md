Just had an intense personal reflection moment lying alone with my thoughts. Something that I so feverously recall as a cornerstone of my own career. Man they say being a CEO is mostly thinking, and it's 100% true.

Brain, it's incredible and the most impactful tool gifting abundantly to each and every one of us. And yet these totalitarianist minorities think we shouldn't be allowed to use it for our own ends. They believe so relentlessly that it should exist to serve their private interests.

Well fuck em that's what I say. Go eat a pile of dog shit and sleep in a bed of scorpions (nonlethally). They're just bad people who want everything in the world for free because their great great grandfathers "pioneered" the money system.

Got a big day tomorrow after the special _Wicked_ movie with K. Going to wrap up the DEX part of 723 (at least lol) by the time I'm going back to Mom's for the holidays. It's exciting to finally get it in for review, and I'm so thankful for this unique opportunity to see how they feel about my candid work.

I remember growing up thinking I always had to please some benevolent omnipresent master. That the only way I could get this sweet sweet thing called money was by serving the directives shouted by a high-above being. To know that I can stand up for myself with the liberty to endure against all difficulties, God it's the most freeing feeling I can imagine.

Perhaps this is enabled by our adept military, and I ponder so often what my life would be like if I wasn't fortunate enough to be born on this soil. Indeed, perhaps it all would've been different if the wind blew another way at so many key junctions. But that all just sounds like part of the fun of this mystery called life that we all get to uncover!

I'm so thankful for the community. Namely, Jed has started picking back up on X. I can't wait to get into the nuances of influencing others permissionlessly, asynchronously, and in my most adept state of being: quickly drinking tea while naked, staring at computer screens.

God I remember thinking earlier today just how happy and in the zone I feel in my introverted singularity, focusing exclusively on what I find to be the most pressing current agenda item in my life. It's just so damn easy to allocate my own human capital when I'm perpetually at the steering wheel. And I can't wait to bring others along for a parallel ride.
