I probably shouldn't be writing this late, but I've just been so thankful since yesterday. I had another banas session diving really hard into emotional realizations over some old music. Im trying to take more care in these personal outbreaks so to speak, but man they are just so revelaing-as if the universe is speaking directly to me.

SO glad for the guiding light of my goals, which were randomly highlighted by Heisman interview. Saw it since just got back to CLT and Grandpa picked me up from the airport since mom and Chris went to work party. Had a blast talking with them along the ride and at their home waiting.

Today was a big wawaykeing for me in terms of abundance. Maybe related to K dcashing all her oarents savings bonds, seeing things there was snice, but I felt it more the night before. Saw n Red One that there are really respectful sociel implications for smarts.

It feels so incredible to know that I have enough. So magic to feel wholeeartedly that in my life exists plenty. And I finally feel in in my health, relationships, and money.

I know I preached this abuncdace years ago. And man what an impact it had.. Now I'm kjust so very thankful that its blessings have entered my conscious.

It really just feels absoluitely incredibleto know that everything will be alight. Not only alright but awesome. I even bought myself sme Camomile tea bags at Dunkin!

O'm so gad this is private, because it gives me a moment to just htink about myself for once and ignore the whims of others. O'm so oncredob;y tjamnlfi; that there are people in this world who'lll give me money just for who I am and what I do, period. It's an incredible feeling to have securty not just in family ties but also across my sociel communities
