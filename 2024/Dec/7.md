Last couple days have been reruns of some recent end-of-week revelations. It seems so much pony art music from BGM paralls my particular journey and personal viewpoint as RD of "the group." This moving fast mentality of an innovator so-to-speak materialized in a binge with K yesterday as she enjoyed the Sabrina Carp Winter Netflix special.

It was during this period and after watching_White House Down_ again that I remembered the importance of my dominant perspective in shaping effective policy. In general, it's been a meaningful recent discovery as to the material amount of effort I've invested into simply fueling my own persona so as to have firey public "arguments" in the influence perspective. I've always been astounded by just how much effort it takes to come across lively in the public sphere, although I'm sure it comes more naturally to others.

I'm so very thankful for my nuanced understanding of this reasily, and it fgraciously empowers me to empathize with others in similar positions.. It's been fun coming back homem to continue prudent work while intermittenly relaxing with k. I'm so very thankful for all the livelihood stabilities we've accumulated over the years which so prudently enable continuing work focus.

Ineed it's been quite a few years since anybody technically paid me money, which I presume and understand to be largely my own choice. I'm just thankful for the present ability to correctly configure policy before we start scaling in the typical business sense. Markets are just something that really need to be aproached from the public goods perspective before any profit considerations, and I wonder what other activities might fi that mold.

I'm extremely thankful for my nuanced understanding of markets thanks to years of dedicated experience directly from the individual investor side. I honestly can;t think of anything that would get me closer to the pusle of fiat cpaitlism itself. That I've had the time through primary and secondary education to intermittenly (or often quite more) dive into trading&mdash;it was such an incrdible experience tht I'm sure to use in one way or another for the rest of my life.

Recently, I've been thinking much about what the distant future will looks like, presumng goal achievemnt and such. I remember always drooling ovr a propoer trading setup and the general technical investing lifestyle. But in a similar light to Jerry, perhaps that's a vision more geared toward idealistic vigor.

Indeed, it just doesn't seem to be the best use of my time given what I know now to be professionally trading anymore. Ineed, it feels more and more like I'm doing things that are at least 5 years ahead of the mainstream curve. And over and over I see my actions validated years after the fact. 

I'm thankful for the prudence all my past work has awarded me. And I apprecite the [place tradtional external asset managemnt has broughten me to sustainably today. But it seems these skillsets could be better utilized in my own systemic operations.

Namely, recently it's beccome apparent that my intense technical bias toward Stellar has led to missalocation of some of K/Yen's capital towards more long-term means. These actions effectively squandared their returns due largesly to my own contentions with the infrastructure commonly in place for investments. However, a purely analystical trader inside me not but three years ago would've easily idenitfied and invested meaningfully starting in 2023.

Thankfully, my knowledge has heloed me succeed in my own work, but it's also brough tthat focus away from trading. My conundrum now is that going back to traditional asset management in the stock trading (or other asset) sense would allow me to only receive returns up to the rate acchieved by others, at least withut going back into full active managemet mode. And if I know my long-term passive growth will outsize those assets, then it's quanderous to waste alpha llocating resources outside my rpdocutive communtiies.

Thankfully, all this can easily get remedied through prudent decentralization. Once I / we attain our / my vision for independent money managers, these relatively-simple trading alphas cna be captured directly by the masses using tested trading strategies from _nine to Noon_ and others. That way we can all trust the markets are working well because it is the specialized traders without this burden of knowledge whom can best allocate capital emossionalessly as one would expect from an invisible hand.

There's a lot to build coming ahead, and I'm so thankful to finally feel in a position of leadership and ambisiton to truly compelte it all. Our oopportunies have never been this grand before, and it is honestly incredible that we cna build such an expansive future ogether. Thank you univser for everyting that's brogh us up to this point and set us up for abudnace.
