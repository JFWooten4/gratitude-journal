I've been pushing this back for some time as I wait for family photos, but they seem to not be arriving in any reasonable time. Perhaps it's time to contemplate further the purpose of this journal. Namely, I know I've done them in the past for gratitude and planning, and I want to make sure I get exactly what the main purpose here is.

First of all, I'm so thankful for Mom and Dad for hosting an incredible Thanksgiving adventure for us together. I also super appreciate seeing Christopher, Chris, and Aunt Patty. Not to mention, Grandma and Grandpa were just the best!

It was fun to reconnect a little more engineering-wise with Grandpa. I learned about some of the cool military things he worked on like a huge radar laser tower thing in North Dakota and some adventures on a seaplane. Turns out he retired at 58 from IBM and all around pretty nice outcomes.

Mom took me to an incredible football game where Panthers lost to an underdog in overtime, after missing two field goals in the game! That was quite fun, and it was a nice distraction from the yearning I've had for K while away <3 She was so sweet once I got back, even made lunch for Dad and I.

Met Dad on the flight back to Cinc and we spent the day together in the train museum before going to a nice steakhouse for dinner. He was so kind in getting everything going, and we had a great time at breakfast the next morning before driving back in a rental Mustang! He seems well and wants to see me more as nearing retirement.

With the Mom side of the family, I noticed that most of the fun we had was in the first couple days I was there. Afterwards, we watched movies and TV together, but I guess maybe needed some gusto to go and do fun locales. That was something I found well with Dad.

Anyway I think this journal winds up being something a little more therapeutic for myself. It's a nice feeling to sit in a quiet room alone and silently type out and be with my thoughts. I hope that all these reflections can wind up meaning something one day in work that really helps a lot of people.

I know that it helps me keep peace in my own soul, which certainly grounds my daily life. Part of it now that I'm typing more reminds me of the DVORAK question, as I always want to do things in the most efficient way. It's because of this that I think it'd be so great to swap over, but the logistics of it all just seem impossible to accept (time, config, and physical future compatibility).

Maybe that's one thing that I can start turning more into a strength. I spend a lot of time thinking, and perhaps my daily life doesn't need to revolve around explicit word output. Rather, it can be as it has been with stern contemplation prior to intentional publications.

These releases don't need to be explicitly verbose, and certainly I've had no challenge making them amply detailed with the traditional constraints of QWERTY. It's nice that they have you learn typing in school, and interesting to see how it evolved and still works well today. That said, I'm thankful for modern keyboards and hardware that let me document and reflect on thoughts like these.

Again, I want the point of this to be for myself, in helping me sharpen the greatest asset I have sitting inside my cranium. I was thinking today about selling some lumens to get a new computer (that actually works). I realized that, while I want to make XLM the currency, I should take a holistic approach to capital allocation.

Specifically, I recognized that the total value I can offer the market is so much greater than the modest amounts I can accumulate in these early days using limited savings. Accordingly, while it does make sense to invest, it doesn't make sense to hoard out of irrational scarcity. I can and should use funds as I best see fit to advance all facets of my objectives, including the transfer of assets to others as incentives for innovative work.

I'm very thankful for the incredible community we have now allowing any most passionate contributors to self-elect their valuable services via labor. I just hope so earnestly that we can continue sustaining these open developments and am so incredibly thankful for the pioneers who've showed ways to do just that. I feel so much better daily knowing that there are paths forward to make all these new things work well, and we can achieve them as we grow together.

Again, awesome trip with family, and a great relaxation to decompress. I've got an action-packed week coming up before travelling back there and subsequently configuring family events. I appreciate everyone so much and can't wait to share my generosity and abundance with the family, which the universe has so gratefully bestowed upon me.
