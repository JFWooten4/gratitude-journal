## ednesday

Fun remmebering watching Wicked movie with K sime earlier time this month afte thngaksigivng. ANwya, had an inredible Christmas with everyone and thier special presents. Start of day was presents, presents, presents with K, Russell, and self. Everyone was very sweet and nice to know more family can and do caeabout me. It's just one material way to see it, but it's certainly a nice visualization.

Mostly staying at home to playwith treats thanks partic=al,y to K making yummy keto white-chip macadamia cookies. We didn't have any almond milk ot enjoy them with, so Russell scavenged out to find an Indian store that was open since thye didn't practice xmas. Hew was so sweet getting a chocoalte healthy drink, since he didn't find anything at the gas station he went to yesterday to get it. Also got to enjoy the first game of Mario Party where K won, o she was super excited.\
