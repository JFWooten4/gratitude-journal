# Dreams

Another dream on liquidity advocacy last night. Don't recall the specifics,  but dcertaiely somethign about sponsoring Tyler and others to grow reputation in community. Missed some per recent time contraints back at Mom's so just need t o get back in the habit of writing them down when i wake up.

I like doing it because it's incrdibley important to listen to your subconscous, nad thats exactly what I get to do when recording mydreams. It wasa staple use of the old paper daily journal in the trear section, albeit that was more for periodicaly ingenous isions. But I erblive in the power of these REM simulations, and surely consistency beats spurratic documentation.

It's great that I can search them through here now, given the dreams repo. I was thinking about making it pricate. I'll ask around on specifics.

Love the transparnecy it provides everyone, but not jsure how it affects the image of my account.

I guess part of it is that I am happy to share ever facet of my work. And I couldn' give less of a fuck hwat 
fuel" it coves csomeone reviewing ti all.

But I just want to make sure that it;s not overwelcming or spammy. Seeing repeatative commits like that just might not  give the bst impression if it's all people see for a day. PN the other hand, it does make my commit history look good via paddings outs. MayBE IT;'S JUST A SMALL IMPLEMENTATION NUANCE THAT I SHOULDTN WORRY ABOUT.

THE WORST PART FOR ME SI SPELLCHECKING IT ALL, SO PERHAS I CAN JUST MAKE IT PLAINLY PERSONAL BY INCLUDING THE TYPOSES LIKE THIS. Then people would know itsa de-minimus wip project. W'll see.
(not caps lol)

# Traveling

Last week was awesome wiht so fmuch family! We had such a blast that i completely ran out of time to reflrect. Lol some nights we'd e up to 1 or 2am just playing with pfamily.

## Saturday

When I got to CLT, Mom picked me up with Chris and we had a fun chat and ride back home. It was ;already pretty late lol, but before leaving i had a great time iwth K. We got to go to the bank for her bonds, the Costco for the groceries, and a yummy chicken bake from the gfood court. She was so excited for that one and absolutely loved it!

Plus, just before swinging by the airport, we got to go to build-a-bear and some other fund stores she liekd at the little mall. Not to mention the post-security club airline food was pretty nice and soupy yums.

## Sunday

Anyway then on the next day, I got to hear about Mom's adventures selling Panther's stickets for a loss because lol nobody wanted to tsee them out in the cold lose. Chris went by himself becausse he is big football guy, and mom and i got to stay home together. Wee had a tgreat time playing ping pong for a n extreme people v. dog extrveganza. Lol I remember if we dropped the ball the dog would try to eat it up, and she did a coulpe times just inher mouth!

Just some fun movies after that, and glad we got to be together. She was also nice nough to share food and tea while we relaxed al itte. Even got to see some Netflix movie and such while playing on the couch. Remember the plane one nad revealing film about easy totalitarian benefits under centralization v. a dirctly and wholly free soiety.

## Monday 

Anyway, next day was equally fun when I got to go to breakfast with Jake. I have some reflecting to do on that later inthe a micro blog post, because it was an interesting and fun experience. Glad he's doing well and absolutely loved that breakfast place he found.

Fresh OJ they scqueezed was divine, seruousy. A rare treat and superb point of recognizing abundance. I remember throwing a few bucs of gas in to fuill up Christopher's car, ad it just felt o good to chave the conviction to do that and spend caseh out on the town as my own indeependt person.

Everything I need is within reach of my own resources. It's really just down to execuin and implementation onw, which I love love love. Back to being a man who just makes calls and stays dominanet. 

Next was the dentist, and I was gla to see that there was nothing major with the little dot on that tooth guy. Had some fun with mom earler playing aorund whith hwat numbre it was lol. Still not a magic dentist, but again really glad everything going okay with that one.

Rest of the day, nothing crazy made some food pasta green brocoli yummies. Went awesoemly o ntop of te earlier breakfast keto bowl. Mom had a blast coming in to sniff the kitchen lol. 

## Tuesday

This is when Chrstopher started doing a ot (he came in late hte night before). We had a lot of fun chatting in he mornign while we waited to see Dad that night. In the awaiting afternoonm, we watched _Boondocks_, which was suplrisingly funnya and fun.

Definately done iwth TV and maintstream culter etc. But it was a nice refresh to get some media consumed with Chrstopher together. While I migh not enjoy entertainment content mostly, it's always nce to spend time with family. And if that menas sitting in frontn of osomething pakyful, thn I;m all for it.

So the nwe drove downtow nadn met Dad at nice french frresaturnt he went to ealier that day for work. It was a simplyw alk to anear his office from the aparmtent oarking, which was fun to have with Chrstopher. Onne thing I noticed that night is that men get to enjoy brisk walks without needing to slow down for girly things - super appreciated that efficiency.

Once we got there, it was a great time. hrospher enjoyed some cool ffFrehnch beer that Dad pciekd out. Got a few and went crazy for it lol!

Then just a ton of fun conversation between everyone, castching up on how all things are going in boy talk. Was funny: CChrospther alost wore a polo that looked exactly like the ones employees had.

Gos hthe food ther ewas amazing. So much tasty butter which went exceptionally with the delicate meats. Remmeber  a  deloicious bone marrow beef taratar... ah just incredible like the finale foi gous duck licver yhummy.

Also had yummy salads, chicken, adn desserts. It's nice to not need to wrorry about sugary things anymore. Seriously, jstu the blanket "no I don't do that anymore" kike I've done with asset managent feels incredible. To just know that it's a part of me to not eat sugar - ah I cna't express how eay it makes my daily life and discipline.

I'm so thankful and happy K came around to gthat, because i now she lieks sugar and alll that. She's so acepting and lvoing - it's really something nice to have around. Chrsotpher was sincerely admirational about how we met and continuied prospering togehter.

After idinner, we waled out past heir fun Xmas tree with italian ornaments. Also got a sweet pic at the buildign soemwhere with a train. Really want t oget some kind of personal image hosting thing where I can associate these relfections with all photos from the day so it's easy to refernce iwhtout all the manual / central incsertions through github.

Anyway, we got back and I snagged Dad's gift and other clothes out of the trunk, while Christopher and him chatted inteh aparmtent. They stuck around and had some fun together for about an hour thereafter .
