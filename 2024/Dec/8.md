Been gnawing on that ever-present question of control again. What does it mean in a decentralized society? Namely, can we really have deadlines when the best work continually flows toward a synchronous goal?

I'm very thankful for my natural gift of curiosity. I don't know exactly where it came from, even thinking back to my childhood experiences. I'm also so thankful for my early lifetime interactions with trains, as they seem to have built major foundations into my moral sentiments.

Saw some interesting content circa the Boring Company today, and I'm really impressed by what Musk's doing in Vegas. So thankful to have him as an aspiration to look up to growing up, proving that someone _can_ make it on their own with the drive of a champion. Thankful he's about to fix some gov things and appreciative of his unparalleled skill at dismissing haters, something useful for models.

While I'm extremely grateful for my ability to see the world as it can be, I'm also extremely thankful for my ability to see the world as it is. The curiosity which translates into immense deep technical research—it's a gift that keeps on giving. I probably wouldn't've believed it years ago, but I can see so clearly and thankfully now that knowledge does indeed compound, acting as the key ingredient in being a bona fide expert.

The early days like T-8 years might seem challenging building blocks, but I wouldn't trade them for anything—they've been a helluva fun ride. I sincerely appreciate all the people that have helped me along this journey, a path list that would be just too long to begin here. And I really appreciate all the abundant love everyone's shared with me.

Maybe I'm just procrastinating from work here and this is a longshot, but dare I propose that the universe is the greatest "central" arbiter and allocator of mental capital in existence? If we follow the "radio waves" ideology, then somehow this grand ether connecting us all manages to behest reality to our wills. Definitely out there, but I can't help but massively appreciate these immense powers (putting it lightly) which I first saw pointed out by Napoleon Hill. <3
