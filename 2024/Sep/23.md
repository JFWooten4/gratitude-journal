Sometimes it feels like nobody cares about what I'm doing. Other times it feels like the world is finally adopting the most efficient systems. It's an endless back and forth emotionally, which can get challenging.

I'm so thankful for Kayla and all her support across everything I do. Yesterday was a tremendous reflection day, and I wish so much that others understood its power. It feels a lot better having those thoughts off my mind.

Now that I have the space to think, it's become abundantly apparent how much AMM design matters for trade quality. It's disheartening at best to think about uncoordinated execution. I'm so hopeful that I can get people up to speed.

I know I've got a ways to go, and I just hope we can all get there together.
