# Labor Day, yay!

This last weekend has been a tremendous time with K and her parents. We finished getting the house set up for them at the end of last week. The new furniture from Mom has come in super handy as a perfect finish-out of the apartment.

K's Dad ordered us a mattress topper for the pull-out twin sofa, which worked out splendidly! We've been working with that and the full bed in K's extra gaming room. Her Dad also got us some tools and nails to hang up some of her vinyl items and TV!

The room is coming together really nicely, and we had a stellar time washing the cars and setting up the yard hose with her Dad. Looking forward to cleaning out the garage soon with spraying into the drain. Also, it’s been a fun time thinking about how that could be a home for the children of the corn, lol.

# Funny family outings

On the first day Russel and Yen got here, I got to take them on the rail trail up and around the town. That was a super awesome little outing, and we got to have fun with them as we went around town and got stuff for the weekend. Then we headed to the park for some fun discussion, snacks, and tennis adventures with Yen.

Mom has also been super fun the last week or so, sending her pictures of the newly finished apartment. She’s been working to get the title over for Grandma and Grandpa's car, which was really nice. Then this last weekend, we got to go on adventures with K's parents in Indianapolis.

We went to the Asian food store, mall, and Costco to get Japanese food store items, Vietnamese special hot dogs, and yummy Macadamia nuts. K got a Miniso special surprise box, where she opened it at home and got the super special mage limited edition version! It was a really good time snagging Japanese sashimi lunch with the family, and everyone was really happy to be chauffeured around town.

# At home shenanigans

We also got to make some keto apple pie with the apples we got from the apple-picking farm. That was a super fun outing with K and her parents just up the road! We got to pick from the different trees and had a really great time—I know it was on her bucket list.

So I got to make the crust with some yummy cacao nibs, and Kyala did the filling perfectly! Then, I got to make everyone a lobster dinner, with some of it done in the apple BBQ sauce from the farm. It took some time, and everyone was super excited about it and loved the flavors, including tons of veggies and yummy cheesy potatoes for K and Yen.

It's really nice to have found myself a family away from the family that's similarly enjoyable to be around. It's been so much fun this last while being with everyone while work tunes along at a pace. Excited for the coming regulatory steps in globalizing our markets on the basis of the presently simply unacceptable system that nobody seems to understand.
