So incredibly thankful for an unbelievable graduation weekend with K and family. Loved welcoming them to town with trips to special nail and food stores, hearty meals at French and Korean BBQ joints, and celebrating at all the Agnes events. We made some superb lobster pasta together, played around with Aunt Pam, and saw all of K's friends one last time â€” they are so nice! Looking forward to this next chapter with anticipation. The OCC comment this week is going to be revealing, transformative, and persuasive. And don't forget the enthralling Renaissance Festival! Love the nice teachers from education.
