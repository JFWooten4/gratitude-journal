I guess its only been six dasys,b ut it certainlly feels like a lot longer than that to me. I know people say time "gets faster" when you start growing up and sch, but tbh I'm not concinced. Like I'm still only 23, and the last four years of building BT has just been so prevelant in my mind.

Every day has always been an exciting new adventure to unover how we might best organizze society;s capital. And as all this going on, there continue to be some quite enjoyable developments in the market. I may not know exaclty what the future holds, but it's absolutely thrilling to see things turning up in my fdirection.

Kayla would call this "coming up Kayla" because she says she's always so lucky and such. I love that mentaliy about her, and ma so excited ge get to go on this journey together. I recall laterly some things I said in the def. journal from just prior uncoving DRS.

That podcast really was a life0changing introduciton. And to thing that it was justa few short weeks after the ultimatum we had in the parking lot for the plasma donation center. K was finally sick of it after going at least 6 tomes between the medial confrimations and times her pressure or some shit was too low.

So we left that parking lot and went to the asian foods store that day. In total, I/we got $300 of the 500 intro offer per person, and K felt bad since her middle time they couldn't prick her properly, and the difference in time was too great for them to even use her stuff. I still remember listedning to Audible _Animal From_ the last time I had collection.

She was so sweet, just a little while afterwards she offered and had me us all the money on the card they gave her. She's never really been about money, although we sure did have a fun time using Dad's credit card to go on all those dates while I was in school ~year and then little less the second year. God I can't wait to have enugh money to live somewhere fun and keep doign those things iwth ere every week; rn it's a 40min drive every time we want to go out.

But that didn't stop us yesterday when we got to go to the suchshi plasce she;s been dying for in the next town over. I wanted to do sometign special, and it was an easy call after luemns quadrupled in these last few days. We got a fun sushi boat, and really enjoying the holiday lights in the small area.

Speaking of lumen,s I'd be remiss if I didnt reflect on this a little bit. I know I can't express it fully publicly since i need it for congressional arguments, and for that I'm very thankful to have it. But it still sticks with you after you accept it.

Basically I had a choice to make at 8.7 when I knew they wouldn't let me / K withdraw in USDC to the DEX. I descided to wait , knowing full well that it could cost K up to 100k based on coming price action. Man, it hfjidlshfuilcxnjvklhu yeah and so I wasn't too far off - - fko

They say apricniple isn't really a principle unless it costs you money. And I know that principle is wroth any short-term expense. There's just such a largetr pictur ein play here, and I pray we can get everyone to understand this materiality.

Anyay, I'm so glad to have K here to brighten up my long weeks f passionate work-rpdctu output. Lol I made that term up because I think it captures the time * specialization that does into careers. I'vebeen continually reminded that hse efofrts can scale geormetircally with the enticing sttimulation from sexuality.

Speaking of, I discovered  some mnew MLP artists and their communtiyies this week, whcih really inspired me emotionally. Their music has dircelty talked to me in terms of the important stage as I step into the protagnaist persona of rianbow dash, and it seems Chvies falls into the archetype of Twilight. It's been itneresting to think about these firendhsip mane 6 implications over the past few months as we work towards a final system that has no single rules of all the lands, so to speak.

And then this weekend, I went thgouh quite a few movies where walls crumble down to relveal tall the possabiltiies avaliable to a society. There always seems to be this direct conflict between certain business interests (incl governing power itself) and the freedom quite readily avalible in abundance to all who take it. oI wonder so vividly how joyous our society might becoemese once the masses cna organize likewise qcross realms.
