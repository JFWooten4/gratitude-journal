I'm so incredibly thankful for Mom. So very grateful for Dad. And appreciate so greatly Christopher.

Thank you thank you Grandma and Grandpa. And I appreciate you so much Aunt Patty. And I love and thank you so very much Grandma and Grandpa.

Thank you thank you Kayla — for everything. Thank you all and so many more who've brought me to where I am today. Thank you to the beautiful world and its magnificent economy for revealing to me especially this incredible chance to right such a historic meaning.

I am so very grateful for the gears lining up as we near this new administration. I can honestly say that I've put every trade I fathom into this next step. I thank so ferociously the god in my mind who've helped so prudently guide me along this exceptional journey to finally bring liberty to all.
