I'm so very thankful today firstly for my aging family. I love them so much and they do nothing but support me. I got this picture from gma&gpa today (I think it's a good idea to start putting some imgs in throughout):

I'm so thankful for Kayla. She's been so sweet and thoughful lately, and I'm so glad we got to spend a little time cuddling when the Christmas tree power went down. Can't wait for our next relaxing time togehter.

So thankful for Chives, to finally have someone to go through all this with. It's quite a different relationship, and I doubt it would all work without him. So inspiring to see someone else persuing this noble mission wuth tact.
