Wow. What an important week this has turned out to be. I should have known because the second season of Arcane came out yesterday.

It's the morning now, and I'm looking forward to watching the second (maybe third ep) with K tomorrowdsiofjdsiofjiods I mean later today. Man we have had such an incredible weekend so far. A little bit of a splurge, and I'm so happy we had the opportunity for it.

First (yesterday), we went to Costco and got lots of yummies, including a Bari/Centrale bottle for 27. I really wanted to get the industrial gallon crap for K cooking, but I just couldn't stop myself. K also got the big cookie box and loving it :)

She didn't go for the variety because it had macadamia (yummy), something else (yummy), and oatmeal raisin (ewww only good if Dad around!). Anyway it was a fun trip, and I really felt back in my prime leading her around the store and throughout the day. I remember Corey talking about how everything needs to be a surprise.

But I think that logic really only extends to like the locale of a dinner at a restaurant. I don't think it makes sense to be like "today's gonna be an entire surprise" when you need to get groceries, bring preparations (like ID to karaoke bar), and walk a super ton lot. Honestly I don't think he would like K, and that's super interesting because I love her so much.

World has been super interesting. I'll get to that, but to wrap up thoughts on the week: we also got to go to the train museum yesterday!!!!! It is biggest model train museum in the whole wide country and holy shit it was fucking awesome!

Man I love love love the infrastructure side of these things. Seriously it's goddamn crazy nice to see the preliminary plans they used to build out this massive project with so so many fucking awesome trains!!!!! And the gigantic bridges they had — holy shit it was so big and cool I could not believe it!!!!!

Things work like magic when you really plan out the rails, and I hope so truly that we can do that with the financial system. After the museum (and mall before yay she had fun) we went to the Indian Spice Train for dinner because K wanted Indian and IT WAS TRAIN! Lol she just brought some bowls of stuff and such yay. Anyway then we did karaoke in the car ride back which was really fun, K so good at singing.

So much to think about with all those things, and I'm just so glad to have K on my side. Saw the "Heavy Is the Crown" first Arcane ep and to think that I'll have someone to go through all this with is just so nice. She commented how it was so key to have each other as our only real friends out here.

Speaking of, learned that Enrique likes Arcane too! Crazy how good their art productions are, and nice to see other Stellar community members inspired by the mission of collective action against the ruling fiats (with one chief leader, I might add). There seems to be a power struggle emerging because of the recent "Removing SDEX/AMMs" conversation started thanks to Jayrome's posing of 1558 as a question at Meridian.

Namely, there is a lack of strong leadership, which is exactly where the fuck I can come in. Damn it's like the start of WhyDRS (albeit more like re-survival-start kinda) all over again. All I need to do is continue providing value and helping ppl and shit taking Stellar action.... just might be the difference.

Had a dream last night that I was skiing and, at the bottom of a lift, Garand came up to me with laptop and we started coding together. For some reason, we went to the top of the lift together after much coding and questions around 1558 and community chats, but I lost my ski boots. Regardless, I hung around continuing on my laptop while he joined up with the rest of SDF team for something.

When we were at the bottom, we had real comradery and were working like pair coders at breakneck speed. Then I borrowed someone's boots I randomly found, adjusted my skis, and prepped to go back to the bottom of the lift to find my own. But the guy came back and such and I bribed him like $5 to borrow for a run.

I'm so thankful for the extremely talented Stellar engineers developing what the world so clearly needs as this necessary next step towards a free society. And I'm so thankful for the recent opportunities to speak my true feelings without the burden of outside scrutiny, investor sentiments, or fear of job loss. I finally feel so free knowing that my Sponsors won't leave, and in fact might increase their stakes, when I just be myself and stick to it to these Wall St motherfuckers.
