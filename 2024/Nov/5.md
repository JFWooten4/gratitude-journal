Wow wow wow man am I so so so thankful that I started 723 all those months ago. Man wow geez it was legit such a process getting all that rolling. And wow the payoff here has just been incredible.

To think that I might have never even started that PR if I actually ever got any kind of legitimate monies. Like wow :O!! I am so so thankful that I had the wherewithal to get the ball rolling on these things via laptop while at K's parents' old house in Florida after she graduated but wasn't working.

Seriously, Jesus, wow. So so much will come from all this, and I can't thank enough whoever tf it was that started this project idea — and especially Anuxhya who was so helpful in the SCF11 Bootcamp, sharing her motivations to similarly join the network for humanitarian cause. And man I can't believe how different my life might be if she didn't pop into that interview to share her thoughts with the WhyDRS community.

Legitimately mind-boggling to think how differently all this could've played out without driving all those damn hours to Houston! Lol wait that was some other missed changed flight thing in re the SF trip for the first Lemmy post. Lol I guess that was in Austin — man what a cool transit sys and honestly not the worst parks to sleep in.

God is on my side. Holy motherfuck. These Wall Street assholes have their coffin set, and I am so so so thankful that the replacement will give masses of people real savings and retirements.

I guess wooten.link/bad was sorta like a donation to some early adopters lol (src txn bro!). These people are miracle-workers. They've been literally handed into my life by God to build 99% of TAD3 lol!
