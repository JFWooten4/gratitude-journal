First day at Mom's for Thanksgiving today, having a fun time hanging out with family! I'm thankful for Aunt Patty who's having fun knitting a blanket right now. We had quite the time coming to Charlotte yesterday with a fun airport setup.

It's been an exciting past few days getting great work done before the nice break with everyone. Biggest thing has been putting my efforts behind making Stellar the standard and such, which has really paid off in both the recent wins on advancing liquidity efficiency and the drastic rise in our net worths. I had the realization one morning that we finally made it into meaningful wealth, and that was and is an absolutely incredible feeling that gives me stellar chills.

I know it's been quite some time that I've been working towards these things, and it feels just amazing to have not only the community but the fundamental backing to really make all these things into a reality. The oversight of the entire system feels right in my hands, and I'm so thankful that they consider me as a commissioner potentially. I don't have much to really back that up, but I noticed that I've been able to almost feel when things are happening far away, which I'm very thankful for.

Basically, whenever I'm next to an internet source like a router, I can sense when something important is happening. It might just be in my head, but I feel so truly that it's a sincere tangible event asking for my immediate response. These last few days it was Tomer diving into my GitHub profile, so I sent some signals back by both broadcasting my voice to the universe and fixing some needed cosmetic updates just in main, as far as I could tell.

I hope so truly and appreciate so greatly for and in the powerful work of Napoleon Hill, and the magic it enamored my life with so early on and fortuitously. While the future has a few divergences to opportunity examine, I've never been more confident in my vision for a truly fair capital market, as embodied in that coal statement I made seven years ago. And to see it all now finally materializing not just in technology but also in my family life itself with K, certainly something special.

We got to enjoy a sushi boat in the town next over this last weekend after some fun holiday cheers, even setting up the tree decorations and such later. And then we enjoyed the news that she was getting a 300/mo raise next year, as some laws or such changed for salaried, nice! And ofc once she got home from her early shift yesterday, we raced to that sweet overlooking tavern in Cincinnati just before the airport, enjoying the hell out of a hastened bite together.

It's been so nice stepping into my masculinity to define precisely the most important aspects I have the good fortune to specialize in. Indeed, I've been so feverously enjoying recent work thankfully due largely to the perfect execution of my skillset in the markets. I yearn for the day I can share those passionate results with the rest of the world, no matter how small my overall part.
