Today I got invited into the secret mastermind Discord for DRSGME/WhyDRS founders/influencers. That was cool, thanks to Chives. Itâ€™s been a pretty eventful few days publishing 300+ videos from the Think & Grow Rich and Friendship Social Skills Courses to YouTube alongside the Nine to Noon Audiobook. I feel happy having put that quality education content out there gratis. Also really finished tying up the channel with final documentaries. I'll probably shut it down as soon as I can get BT funded and off to the races. Definitely want to bring on a team and make it something special down the line per Reflection Day recently. Looking forward to exploring opportunities with a community behind me. Thankful for the web.
