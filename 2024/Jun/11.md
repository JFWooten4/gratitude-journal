Loved these last few days working on open-source developer documentation. It's been incredible to understand the amount of work that goes into all these free software projects via a group of passionate, permissionless, and prevalent dev contributors from around the world. Really thinking we need a way to incentivize these quality makers to build and advocate for an equitable, worldly OS.
