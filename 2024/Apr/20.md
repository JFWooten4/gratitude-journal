Fun week filled with great work and fun times with K. Got to see fun movies today with her and had takeout. Last weekend was the dance with A, and it was crazy all night long! We went to a club very early in the morning and got lost going back to the car. Really exciting, sweet-filled day. This week, I was happy to make big progress on open-sourcing and investing in the DAO. Time filled with happiness, and Dad's Charleston meeting is coming up right now!
