Today I read about the Supreme Court securities laws, which was super fun! Went back into Bridget Pennington stuff, and I have to say that a lot of it is legal crap from inefficiencies in capital formation. I really fundamentally disagree with it... But I totally see where he's coming from, the impact it can have on people, and how all the pieces are there for success. Honestly, I probably would have looked about the same if I went down the online marketing path. So, I'll accept — but not endorse — him. I really do wish him nothing but the best, but I can't take him as a source of further information.

I don't understand why there has to be so much legal involvement in routine 506 placements. Sure, there's some asset management stuff, but it really all just needs to be simplified. That is, the companies and investors should be able to very easily connect. However, as we build out TAD3, I think it's very important to see our work as basically making being private the same as being public, at least from the secondary liquidity perspective. I take on this responsibility and must protect the industry through proactive compliance anticipations, developments, and thought leadership. Tackling the first with Blue Sky Laws next week, developments through investor perspectives tomorrow, and leadership through prominent media/industry placements next week. Godspeed.
