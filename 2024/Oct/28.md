Here’s your text with spelling corrections:

Had a weird dream last night where Dad texted me that Christopher had a car crash and needed help in California. So I booked a flight and met him at the crash site. He was Tokyo drifting too fast around a mountain bend corner lol.

When I got there, he told me that I need to stop listening to Dad so much (I never called him or anything); said that it would be better to do things for myself and such. Then I got trapped in the restaurant nearby with him.

For some reason, the owner was crazy and we both wound up there for some time at the close. Then we tried to find somewhere nearby to stay the night. The car was stuck on a hill in the forest, and Christopher didn’t want to call the insurance company for fear of rates going up.

I lamented at the silliness of insurance when nobody actually uses it and such. We found a nearby home for sale, and it looked nice so I was just like let’s buy it lol. But there were people inside with all their things, and they didn’t want to give us a later tour, especially since someone was coming the next day to stage the house.

Great night and surprisingly exciting weekend, after pivoting plans away from karaoke (moved to next week). Yesterday we went to pick apples at the orchard on about the last day of the season. K took her pretty pics by the remaining flowering trees, looked so happy.

I was so thankful for the gorgeous ride out to the orchard, where we saw the beautiful fall leaves across the trees. Loving the time we get to spend together in our own little world out here. Also was Mom’s birthday and she had an incredible time with parents and Chris with flowers back in Clt.

She got a randomly marketed book gift delivered the other day, which was weird. Some agency that did some of the Grant Cardone stuff, which I appreciated growing up. I love that capitalism allows the whole world to work without any central totalitarian intervention.

That has really been inspiring me lately. Seeing how the profit motive alone can efficiently organize vast amounts of labor—it’s just breathtaking when I really think about it. And it makes me ponder over how much influence I really have with my purchasing power.
