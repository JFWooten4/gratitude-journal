Had a wierd dream last night where Dad texted me that Christopher had a car crash and needed help in California. So I booked a flight and met him at the crash site. he was tokyo drfiting too fast around a mountain bend corner lol.

When I got there, he told me that I need to stop listenng o dad so mcih (i never called him or anything);  Said that it would be better to do things for myself adnd such. Then i got trpped in the restaruant nearby with him.

For some reason the owner was crazy and awe both wound up there for some time at the close. Then we tried to find somehwre nearby to stay the night. The car was stuck on a hill in the fosrest, and Chrsotpher didn't want t o call the insurane co for fear of rates going up.

I lamented at the silliness of insurance when nobody actually uses it and such. We found a nearby home for sale, and it looked nice so I just was like lets buy it lol. But there were people inside with all their things, and they didn't want  to give us a later tour, especially since someone was coming the next day to stage the house.

Great night and suprising exciting weekend, after pivoting plans away from Kareoke(moved to next week). Yesterday we went to pick apples at the orchard on about the last day of the season. K took her pretty pics by the remainign flowering trees, looked os happy.

I was so thankful for the georgous ride out to the orchard, ehwere we saw the beaturiful fall leaves across te trees. Loving the time we get to spend together in our own ittle world out here. Also was Mom;s birthdya nad hse had an incredible time with parents and Chris with flowers back in Clt.

She got a randomly marketed book gift delivered the other day, which was wierd. Some agency that did some of the Grant Cardone stuff, which I appreciated growign up. I love that capitalism allows the whole world to work without any aentral totallitarian intervention.

That has really been inspiring me lately. Seeeing how the proejcit motive alone can effeciently organicze vast amounts of labor - it's just breathtaking when I really think about it. And it makes me quandar/ponder over how uch influence I really have with my purchasing power.
