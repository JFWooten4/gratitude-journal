Happy hallowwen! What a fun day with K and everyone dressed up in their costumes. Unfortiunately, most ptrick or treaters just walked past the house without stoppping to grab some grub. I'm glad they got to have fun traveling around and dressing up.

Been so thankful laterly for my unqiue perspective on markets nad opportunity to employ it thought the Stellar community. Others are starting ot use the wording in their vernacular, and I appreacite that my inflience is materializing. Im glad I was able to figure out the advoacay expesne imbalance and get everything back to stasis with the biz bank accounts.

That was a major progress since now I can just focus on soverignly building since all the tools are in place for success! I aprreciate so greatly the support of my community across the online groups helping me achieve my ambitions, often with a shared incentive journey themselves. And I appreciate so greatly the incredibly familt I have that always spreads joy to my head from cheeck to cheeck.
