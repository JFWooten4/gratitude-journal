Happy Halloween! What a fun day with K and everyone dressed up in their costumes. Unfortunately, most trick or treaters just walked past the house without stopping to grab some grub. I'm glad they got to have fun traveling around and dressing up.

Been so thankful lately for my unique perspective on markets and opportunity to employ it through the Stellar community. Others are starting to use the wording in their vernacular, and I appreciate that my influence is materializing. I'm glad I was able to figure out the advocacy expense imbalance and get everything back to stasis with the biz bank accounts.

That was a major progress since now I can just focus on sovereignly building since all the tools are in place for success! I appreciate so greatly the support of my community across the online groups helping me achieve my ambitions, often with a shared incentive journey themselves. And I appreciate so greatly the incredible family I have that always spreads joy to my head from cheek to cheek.
