Wow, another incredible day! Honestly, really helping me out this new bedtime thing! Namely, I got up at 5a this morning which is a marked improvement from last few weeks at 8 or 9. Geeze that was just horrible.

Also, as an aside, I am LOVING the ability to turn the brightness down on my MacBook so that the screen is dark while I type things. This is seriously a stellar feature that makes it so much easier to type shit like this without worrying about typos. Gah always the typos interrupting my flow of thought!

Today I was thinking a lot about outsourcing and decentralization. Namely, I was thinking about how Russell B talked about only recording the audio segment of his podcast before handing it off to the "tech ppl" at work that turn it into a public episode. This got me thinking:

## Specialization

It certainly seems like open source helps people specialize in ways that they can self-identify. This is like super cool — stellar — because wow you get to pick what the fuck you want to do. Damn that's a huge improvement over existing command-and-control work regimes.

Seriously, I don't understand how more people don't venture into entrepreneurship given how fucking much a boss that's directive sucks. Maybe this is why Uber and such are so damn popular. Seriously just the time freedom you get is honestly worth not having to report to a damn limo boss man.

Was strange/bizarre to see those old yellow taxis floating around NY, presumably because of the government monopoly mandate per extensively left (or is it right) leaning city politics. K said she was super surprised at how they looked, and that it wasn't at all what she expected them to be like. I also remember walking past an auto repair shop called "Joe's Yellow Dixer" or something like that that only fixed up yellow cabs.

## Local biz

The shop was really neat, an open-concept mechanics' haven. Super efficient straight door to the street and just a rectangular work room. What caught my eye was that the sitting area (presumably for clients waiting on service) was made of recycled car backseats.

For me, that really showed that the proprietor thereof sincerely understood his clientele in the sense that they were probably pretty smart to do that and such. Yay decentralization. Yay experienced industry intelligence.

## DVORAK

Holy shit my fingers are hurting and I seriously need to swap over to DVORAK. Fuck man.

That's gonna cost me so much money in re swapping laptops out. Like damn fuck is it even possible to recall both DVORAK and QWERTY?

I'm already shit in the sense that I don't naturally return all of the fingers to the home row. Maybe this would help with that? IDK but the strain here is just absolute dogshit.
