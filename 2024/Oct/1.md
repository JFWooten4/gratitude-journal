Ugh it's like 8:something and I can't sleep brug

I have been having such a hard time getting to bed lately because my mind is always racing with ideas

Normally, basic meditation gets rid of this shit, but it's just been impossible for me to do so lately

## Pre-planning

So preplan/scheduling my days went out the window years ago. It was just way tf too much work. And I could innately tell what I needed to do the next day based on gut feel.

When my time is abundant and my cpaitla scarse, i think this is finae and dandy. But as of late my time has been more and more scarese. Namely, I'm dreading an uncoming meeting with a potential reg cf. client from whydrs community.

Like i would really just want to work on teh open source coding neccesary to rbing the syndicate to the next levle, but here I ak talking to one fucking person. It's an saesome person with a stellar idea, background, and experience idl but it;s jsstill just one person. That's something that funametnaly does not scale, promotes gatekeeping ,adn hinders global/perissionless/true innovation./

## Need for change

Clearly something is wrong here, which has only treallys started to memmerge because of the incredbile stellar work these last few months. Ever since I starteed working on that focs bounty, fuck it never ended. So many holes to fill and gaps to bridge - for thw orld at large tbh.

I mrember how intuitive it was to learn stellar through the free documentation, fuck I just wish we had that for everything. It would literally obviate the need for college becuase you could just learn whatever the fuck you want and then apply it in practice via trnapsanrt SCM. Guh.

So, Im thinking I need to change my daily schedule ip;. Particualry, K has been ocmplainitg that we don't get enough time otgether laterly becasue se works will 11. I'm definately the fuck not staying up to 11pm because damn that's crazy late. 

## Plan

Notwithdstanding, I think i need to re-introduce my end-of-day reflection rituat, which menas doing this each day (at a minimum). This used to start at 7:30ish each day, but that time has expended to reuire extensive flossing and focus thereon per actually cleaning my teeth. jdiosafj iofsj iodsfj diof jdsiofj

And agin, the meditations just aren't cutting it for me. What I really really need is an infared sauna. Then I could combine the meditation with an end-of-day detox (physically).

God that would be awesome and I want a house / compelx where I can build hat in so goddamn bad (ideally naked but also thats kinda gross idkk b/c i surely wouldn't both with all that sweat).
so yeah heres my idea:

---

KMove bedtime from 8pm to 9pm. 

Start plannign things to do the next day again (tomaintain focus and actually have a sense of achivement at the ned of the day). E.g. these last few weeks it's been impossible for me to power off my PC because there's lasoways someting more that needs to be done. This was the case for years and years researching the securities frameworks. But it's like actually bad for my well-being. Namely, I'm always reacting ot things leftover from the day before. Historically, this ihas been the only way to approach things becuase I dodn't have a reliabke menas to document shit (e.g. sticky notes time a mallion jesus). but now holy cow it's easy af to get stuff reasonably documented through issues, it's like nothing. So i can just keep that done in my end as aspplicabel.... gg no more mental clutter from 1000,0000 oiepn chroem tabs absolutely killing my locla perfomrance.

Do mediatiaons after the reflection entry, whenrer get done idk but def circa some time lol

fuck im tired, but tankfully im still thinking straight becuase I'm at least back on gluten free after that indulgent trup
