Firstly, I'm very thankful for this new opoprunity to get back on a proper sleep schedule. I feel flawless, which I hesitate to day, but really feeling impeccable after going ot the grocery store today. I grabbed osme chard and kale greens; cooked them up to a delicious green schomegesboard with eggs. 

It feels so stellar to be back eating healthy, esp. yummy greens. K made some delicious soft-boiled eggs to go along with them. Ug so tastey!

Also got to enjoy some interesting nut butter from wharehouse club lol, good on the pecans. I Just am ahppy to be back on a proper diet, and I guess I'm thinkin about it since I spent a lot of time today with food. Maube one day I cna make enough for K to stay home for it.

## on K home

She's been hinting at me lately that she is tired of working. I always knew she just wanted to be a girly girl that stays at home. God I wish to urgently that I  could give that to her in a way that doesn't jeapordize my long-term goal.

Love starts to feel really nice, and I just eeally appreciate that feeling. It;s kinda wierd and soemthing that takes time, certainly. 

Again, just really appreciate her trying to help around the house. Loved seeing her so happy at the Sabrina excursion.

## day info

Some exciting work today in re Syndicate business and community growth. I definately feel like I got sucked into things without those daily goals. Perhaps I can just write them in here for the sake of not duplicating file/dir names.

That's how it was in the physical journal. But it also had a daily scheduling thing. Now that I;m out of school and such, and truly independent at least now from financial burden, I don't think the precise daily scheduling is as necessary.

I really apreciate the discipline it gave me, but truly seems like something tied to an antiquated principles of oosynchronous work. That's why I try to keep the meetings to a minimum, which I think im oding well at. Love that hthey can be a useful tool for conveying key emotional arguments which so often get lost in black and white- well at least without enxtensive work making memes and framing nuanced emojis and such lol.
