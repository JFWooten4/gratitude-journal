K has been pretty damn happy since I did a raw tease last couple times in celebration of recent politicking progress in Stellar community. So thankful to their passionate team making the world a better place. And even further to the expansive community that's sprung up around it.

So thankful for the free publishing and leadership thoughts by Vitalik. Appreciate immensely how prescient his thoughts were. And so glad someone that special is at the helm of the Ethereum community.

Really appreciate the free publications from the Stellar team, even if archives. Can't say enough thanks to their pioneering approach to nonprofit marketing. Appreciate greatly their efficient goal-oriented management.
