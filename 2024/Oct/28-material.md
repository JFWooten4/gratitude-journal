## Evening

Todya K told me about how she felt after the night I proposed to her, as disclosed publicky in the WHyDRS discord. holy ffuck, i was not expercting what she said. oe dman, im gonna need to explain the context to get this

---

Okay so it was the day i found out about the whydrs site, and sent that initial email form sbmission. Man what an incredible day. i was literally glued to my screen eversy second of the day since i found it all

naemly, (and relevantly), I didn't eat the entire day because I was soenamored with it all. but this was a problem because i couldnt afford keto back then. so my mind went fuccck big time work mode the entire day

since i didnt hav e the mental capacity to think at all about social relatinoships, i made some material mostakes that evening. it was so a huge evening. and something so key to K herslef

---

first thing wass that K had been planning for this day for like the hwole week. it was smeting really special to her. and the idea of having a disney date night was at least 3 weeks old, on her part

so the concept is you pick a random disney movie, and the date is that you get to mKe the food from the movie. then you bring the food out as the movie goes in the same order as the movie. so like for this one it was rattatoiu, and she brought out a plate of strawberries and cheese when remy ate strwaberries and hceese in the show

so she researched themovie a fuck ton. apparently, as i earned today, she watched the whole thing's scenes where there was food to understand exclt where it mattered. and she even asked if i could cheat and eat cheese for her special date night

she used to propose a lot of date nights, in an effort tom kae my lef a little easier in re so mcuh work . but se hasnt really since then,and indeed she made me a "date night jar" for my last last birthday back in atl as sometihng to draw from randomly wen i am too lazy to plan a real date

---

i used to spend an ungodly amont of time plannign dates. fuck i would map out every single restarutnt we could go to that i wanted to take us. but there were always more locations than odllars to pay for those dates

man i think so much of how incrible those nights out wouldve been if i had the cash. she was sooooo much more femanine back then. oh my gosh it was like a cat that could absoltel never get enouggh attention - gah so cute

but i see now that this was because i made things so easy for her to feel comfortable. and thats exactly what the fuck isnt; happening how that she has to work full time. god, I know she "likes it", but she has explicitly said that she would much ratehr just chill at oome all day

I know she wants to be a stay at home widfe, and I jsut hope to good that at some point we can finfally have that financial security. namely, this really attracted me to her early on. it was incredible to find osmeone that could jsut support mh ongoingefforts emojitonally

but now she's supporting them financiallt. and thats ducking unnaceptable in my book. it's abotu as bad as me living at home with m mom.

funny i think of that now, since its csoemthing i certainly couldve done wit hmy own office in the basement at her new house. but i knoew so wholeeharteldy that that wouldve ruined my drive and soveritngty. seriously, i soubt i would have made it past the 2022 aug struggle if it wasnt for paying so damn much rent to those wall st motherfuckers at 144

snyesy sll that;s relevant because today she tol me about how xshe felt absolutely soul-crushed by the night. for context, she was crypting crypting crypting by y side begging me to do the disney date dinner. i thought she was crypting and so emoitnoal bcause i asked her to marry me.

she responded with a pretty tender "fo course, baby" and a kiss. but man i was so tired she had to lift me by the chin (i was lying face down o the ground) just o meet her lips. fuck that was such a key moment for her I now understand _not_ because of the propolsal.

it was all because she felt that her "investment" (but not in quotes becase it was a real fucking investment) lf time, efforts, and money was completely wasted when I denied her the opportunity to have her meal fresh. for context, she literlaly worked every fucking our outside of school and the gym on that meal. and the next next day we went to Sam's and userd her dad's crddit card to get the microwave she'd been beegging me to get for forever.

godf it makes me realize how god damned evi; fiat is. ugh i can finally understand it in a way that just didnt click before. it was because i robbed her of the payoff from her investment htat she told me today shes been putting in less effort and really let herself go (OK not really but like she gained some weight at least)

~~and ofc it was fucking fjidsoa fjiodas jfo~~ she quit softball of her own accord while i was in EUR. ugh, all i had to do was accept the universe;s offering in a tender, outstretched hand. it was rewarding mein such a special way for the years and years of work with this incredible communtiy and a perfect dinner date to celebrate.

but i blindngly refused to cease working. indeed, the next week+ was an exceptionally key week to my life due lareestly to the recent context of FTX and ofc the edgar comment. man i seriously considered cc'ing the New York Times on that letter because it means so much tom e
