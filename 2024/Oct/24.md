Today I got to go to the gym and then Walmart to snag some steak that K wanted. Yay it was fun to grab all the groceries and use up the rest of the gift card. Got some delicate and delicious fruit berry tasties.

Been stellar to finally make sense of everything lately and see exactly what's to come with everything. I'm so thankful for this incredible community that sprung up around such an important movement. And man do I appreciate having K along for the ride.

It's crazy to think that the new world order can truly be around a decentralized economy. I'm so thankful for the opportunity to unite everyone against these malfeasant giants. It's all going to change so soon, and I'm thankful to finally be ready.
