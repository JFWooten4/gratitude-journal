Today I got to go to the gym and then Walmart to snag some steak that K wanted. Yay it was fun to grab all the groceries and use up the rest of the gift card. Got some delicate and delicous fruit berry tasties.

Been stellar to finally make sense of everything lately and see exaclty what's to come with everything. I'm so thankful for this incredile cpmmunity that sprung p around such an important movement. And man do i appreciate having K along for the ride.

It's crazy to think that the new world order cna truly be around a decentralized conomy. I;m so thaknful for the opportunity to unite everyone against these malfeasant giants. It's all going to change so soon, and I;m thankful to finally be redy.
