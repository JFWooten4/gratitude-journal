Last few day's I've been realizing the power of community&mdash;and everything just clicked for me. I don't know how, but I just haven't seen it before today. The n I listened to _this day aria_ again, and it all finally made sense.

So thankful to identify DTCC as the lying enemy so simple to replace. And more than that i'm so thankful for realizing that the community is the answer. It's us together that can finally beat them, and I'm so glad and appreciative that I found this lifeful fountain.

I can see the mane 6 materializing right in front of me with the support constantly from friends of friends. I just thought I would apply the MLP stuff to some normal bs job thing, but I am so so thankfull that I hae the opportunity to deploy it now with likely the best community on Earth. And ofc so thankful for stellar being exactly what I asked for back in Aug 2017 before I even knew about it.
