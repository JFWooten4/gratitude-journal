It's the morning for once — got a pretty exciting day ahead of me. The main item on the agenda is an interview with Ankit at 9a. I am so thankful that the universe brought Ankit into my life so serendipitously.

Seriously, how unbelievably incredible is it that I just do what I care about and innovators like Ankit come into my life by magnetic attraction force. So thankful for this reality, and inexplicably thrilled to see them using the "decentralise capitalism" adaptation. On a lesser note, I'm also super thankful that I can set my own schedule and work/sleep when I want/get used to along K.

The recent expansive growth has been awe-inspiring as more work moves to the public realm on GitHub. Some have taken their time bringing things up, and it's certainly different than the "ping-centric" notices we're so used to in a more engagement-centric reactionary economy of online publishing. I'm extraordinarily thankful that so many are so quickly adopting to the platform, which brings them immediately up to speed in something that can truly shape their careers, wealth, and impact.
