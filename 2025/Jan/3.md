I'm very thankful for th emusic that's brought me to where I am today in life. It has really helped me through the tough times when I had noone else to turn to. These artists will presently have zero clue how much their work helped me, and I sincrely can't thank them enough//

-k came how today after i passed out thanks to an action-packed day at work given the new IRS approval news. she was so sweet and always a cute thoughtful baby given shavign today - fn! also enjoying all her cute asian china things; always interesitng to thin about (perhaps a little too muhc)

0world's changing quickly, and I'm so thankful we're here at the corssroads. love the chance to relax and com[rehend everyne's perspectives. and excited to keep working towards maximal effectiv epolicy'

it takes time, adn I;m so thankfu; fro the famly and community alongside my every step - esp at home. I;m also sincerely appreciatign the new move to abudance,m which incudes finally a little release on the tight grip I've held towards perfection. interestingly, I've foun those tendandcies to live onyl in the mindset that there is some lacking.'

but now i know that everyhting is simpy ready and there for the taking thanks to its magniicant abudnance. one downstream affect from this is that I can finally and appreciatively write and act otherwise in reality wihtout such an undying obsessionw ith hitting ,y "lucky numbers" in te sequencing or other planning of wrtiting or actions. e.eg., I;ve continually written triad paragraphs for practically all last half year, and I now finally feel free to tjust express my full and empassioned thoughts given the natural flow frmo which they stem  sometimes it feels like my whole career is a rough raft, and i just keep iterating now by making edits but by continuing the work along more and more refined paths. love it!
