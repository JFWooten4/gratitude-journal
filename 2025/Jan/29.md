I'm very thankful for the hardworking staff at the Commission working to dismantle the regulatory overburdening State which has arisen from the immense centralization of our capitalist system. It brings warmth to my heart to know that our democracy puts in places of authority people who actually are smart.

I'm so very thankful for Russell and how he's helped me learn things from the engineer's perspective over the years. And I love and appreciate the small home improvements he gifted Kayla and me when he took some time to come up.
