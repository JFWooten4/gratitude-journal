Realized last night that the semen retention stuff is just some crap. I subscribe only to the abundant mindset promoted by Hill from henceforth.

Had a moment of scarcity reversion yesterday in getting 5 gal water bottles; a bad feeling like that just is not worth it. I choose abundance and maximum sexuality.

Thankful so greatly for Chives and Green and the whole community. Just got my GH Sponsors 1099-NEC and couldn't be happier. Thank so deeply for their support.
