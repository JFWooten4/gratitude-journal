Wow, what an action-packed last couple of days it's been getting back in the flow of things! I am so thankful I've had the incredible chance to travel abundantly with my family over the years, experiencing the wonders of an expansive world around me with all the uniqueness that comes with it. I might not be a super huge talking person with others, but I always adore seeing them smile and interact with their daily surroundings, taking up their place in a collective society.

It's been a long, long time, and I'll start with when it all began on the 4th with a surprise exciting fun K date day before the flight on the 5th. We got to go to play together all day doing something fun, that's for sure! K got her Labubu eBay-ish doll things and was really excited and happy about those.

Overall, glad we got that last surprise day to be with each other before ending out a longer stretch of contemplation over work. Honestly, for the first four days skiing, I couldn't get my mind off the choice with 3643 comp tokens, and it was really nice to accept them with the abundance which has been growing across the community lately. Sincerely, I feel like we're all working together towards a better future in the way we know how best to, and finally the needless back and forth transforms into collaborative helpfulness.

There are gaping problems and practically useless systems, and I'm so very, very thankful that I now have the chance to rework them into a future sustainable and accessible efficiently to the masses of people on this planet traditionally barred from banking services. I saw many like that on the route out here by one form or another, and it was meaningfully inspiring to me to think about how their lives would all be so much better if there was a unified open platform to manage their (quality equity) investments. Man, it feels good to get that off my chest and into the screen here.

### Ski Trip

After a fairly smooth flight full of audiobook business delight, I landed in SLC many hours before Dad and Christopher. So I hopped on the tram and rode around to downtown. There I found an awesome flight museum with tons of (Utah) aviation tech celebration.

That has been a recurring theme in recent developments with technical excellence, as with the book Russell got me for Christmas. I really appreciate his help seeing things from the hardworking PoV, and I hope so sincerely that the ongoing efforts I dedicate towards this mental clarity release themselves in my diligent work. It can get tough with so much to accomplish, but I've found myself really effectively looking forward and just taking my time to do things, knowing that all I need to do is keep persisting and the path ahead will reveal itself.

Before I met Chives, that was something I wasn't 1000% confident of, but now I can sincerely hold it so close and true to my heart. I appreciate his care and tact with helping me and encouraging ongoing developments while being someone still and rightfully in a personal independence. Honestly, it kind of feels like K, where I finally have someone I can just be myself with and not need to continue spraying up this act of business professionalism (in the working case).

#### Sunday: Train Riding

In the museum, there was a lot of inspiring old work around some of the first in flight (and not at all the NC sense, which was refreshing)! Seeing it from an industrial PoV and inventor's perspective like Da Vinci was absolutely awesome. I was so very inspired by the small and efficient teams that led and built the first lightweight human aircraft and many other local companies that started small and ended up supplying NASA or the Air Force or even all of humanity by means of continuous innovation on root products.

Got to walk around the giant plane body and cockpit from a while back, which was super interesting to learn about in the timeline of the area's airport and military. Also had a cool exhibit of kids watching the moon landing; gosh, they seemed so mesmerized by a historic point. Was really interesting to read the wall captions and see firsthand how the ideation led directly to traditions and real work which touched people's lives commercially or through conflict.

I'm very thankful we live in a time of peace, and I hope so dearly that such collaboration continues in the coming futures. We have a unique opportunity to look towards space as a shared continuing frontier, and I just hope the exterior mining explorations advance fast enough to keep everyone in abundance out there. I can't wait for my own starship one day.[^lego]

[^lego]: As per the day with K, I just finished the LEGO Millennium Falcon she got me for Christmas, and it is literally the coolest thing ever in my life. Like wow, it is so awesome it's kind of insane. Now I'm working on the _Invisible Hand_ ship, and that certainly reminds me of the pending forces TBD.[^dea]

[^dea]: I don't think I've documented this before, but basically when I go on Apr 29, 2151, it'll be through a launch by space pod into interstellar nothingness with the aid of perhaps some one-way survivability helpers. That mission requisites the success of Eden and largely my ongoing traversing of the outer worlds. I look so very forward to those adventures and wonder intermittently now whether I will pilot or elect to specialize elsewhere when that day comes.

On the upper upper floors of the museum, there were some interesting exhibits on AI. Funny, given that that's who will first read and typo-correct this load of text. I appreciate how they were able to update their exhibits to reflect the massive changes we've had in that space over the past few years which so directly grant me the ongoing confidence to pursue this independent course of work, knowing the technical minutiae are only a click away from my intuitions.

Perhaps I should have gone to dinner since I hadn't eaten since the early drive (to avoid the snow), but I was so enamored by all the histories of innovators and thoughts around future civilization that I stayed at the museum practically all day and till the night. By the time I was back on the train, there wasn't much time left to pit stop, so I got to enjoy some more audiobooks while discovering the local transit infrastructure firsthand. It was so inspiring to see the nuanced interweaving of track and road across the vast distances that line covers.

#### Monday: First Adventure

After a pretty and reunionous ride to the resort with Dad and Christopher post-airport meetup, we had the tasty breakfast buffet we've been used to for so many years. Then we got to shuttle down to the mountain and grab our riding gear. It was quickly off to the slopes from there.

Christopher has learned quite a bit and was generally doing an awesome job keeping up. Glad to be with him and enjoyed (perhaps a little at his expense towards the end lol) watching his awesome tricks and rides.

Afterwards, we got a yummy cut of beef at Grub Steak just a short walk away. Fun to go back there with everyone and consume some red things. Was a funny story at the table getting everything gluten free but with breadcrumbs in the spinach LOL, something that really helped me ease into the trip without crazy work in the background.

#### Tuesday: Second Side

After a similar breakfast (for this and every other day!), we drove out in the President's Jeep we rented at the airport. Once we arrived in a primo parking spot at the city/canyon side of the mountain, Dad realized he forgot his helmet and gloves. So I got to do a few runs while waiting for them.

I really appreciate how everyone I know and love gives me the leeway to be myself, with time left in solitude to explore and become my own best person. It's a style of leadership I try so dearly to replicate in a decentralized environment without forced or coerced action mandates. While I sorta missed their original re-approach, they were more than happy to greet me cheerfully and with open arms at the top of the mountain, where all three of us skied around happily for the afternoon.

While this was one of the first trips where I wasn't anally on the mountain at 8am every day, it was also the first time I feel like I really got to enjoy myself with everyone cohesively. Perhaps with finally all our skills getting to a close enough level, things were actually really fun and felt like a family for the first time in a while. I know there's a lot coming to space out myself and Christopher, and I'm grateful that we had this chance before his graduation to really enjoy each other's time and space.

Same for Dad, who worked so hard the whole trip. I know he's close to a breakthrough to finish rounding out his career, and I appreciate the steadfast perspective he's given me on the banking bureaucracy. It's been so interesting to see the stark contrast with Russell's engineering work.

Dinner that night was at a new spicy Mexican restaurant, and it was a fun time walking over there in the chilly weather with everyone. There was a lot of snow everywhere; K even got 8+ inches, which she rightfully used as a penis joke with me. Loved the laughs we all had together as the hot sauces got progressively spicier.

We also swung by the liquor and grocery store with Dad. They had some incredible "local" infused olive oils which looked absolutely divine. I seriously can't wait to hit 1k/mo on GH Sponsors so that I can subscribe to auto-delivery of high-quality oils.

Whew, but enough with that. I should really get back to real work. These writing sessions really help me let it all out. Honestly, I already feel so much better thanks to these last couple hours, and I am so extremely thankful for that. I want to have a full reflection day after TAR1 and the grant stuff, which hopefully can spike some interest from the more XLM-native guys.

#### Wednesday: "Break"/Mid

So yesterday, this lady at the bar at the bottom of the mountain that was a hostess started hitting on Christopher. So we drove him up there and he walked in to get those digits lol. She was supposed to be off this day to hang out with Christopher, but she got called in at the last second.

Nonetheless, C took the day off to relax in the hot tub while Dad and I tried exploring the middle, but I forgot to check the lifts and there really wasn't much open apparently. Strike notwithstanding, we had a fun day together shredding down the other runs of Park City on the back left in the harder areas, and in general it was a great time getting the absolute most out of everything that was open.

When we got back, we played around in the pool area and steam room, as was common to regenerate and such. I'm really thankful everyone can enjoy each other's presence and play while pursuing their own goals like the gym. And it was nice of Christopher to always be abundant in the fruits we shared and such together.

Next, we went to downtown Salt Lake for a sick basketball game. But first, we went to this cool fancy sushi restaurant that Christopher really liked. Dad was excited to sit at the sushi bar where they made some incredible food art things.

Got a cucumber roll which was like nothing I'd ever seen before, and Christopher had tons of fish. Same with Dad, who got us all dessert quail egg and fish egg cucumber cones—fun!

They both had a good time with the Japanese beer and tasty soup things, etc. Yay. I was glad to see everyone getting along and enjoying some fun time together as we started recognizing abundance. I made peace with the work stuff at this point and really was just with them for the rest of the trip.

As for the basketball game, it was the Jazz vs. the Heat, which made for an awesome matchup. Truly one of the first times in a while I've been excited to go to a sporting thing, and I think it was because of the fun atmosphere. I was vibing with Dad and Christopher. They're nice people, and I hope as I grow up I'll find other friends like them to do fun things with once I have income.

#### Thursday: Snowbasin

This was my first time here, and it was an awesome report! Yay, super fun support to crush all the fresh powder on the runs that were super far out. I sorta lost Dad and Christopher early on, just going hard across the whole endeavor, so lol whoops, but man what an intense one!

A lot of the slopes this trip were heavy moguls, which made it just so damn easy to lose everyone out ahead. That's what happened across a lot of these lifts, but I did manage to find and sync up with Dad, and we went up the hard right side together while C took a break with a beer.

The views from an observation building were incredible, and man the ride down was just so smooth. Really enjoyed meeting up with everyone there and the incredible bottom with so many heavy lifts and gondolas. Then we met back up with Christopher and went to the peak of the middle.

There, we saw an incredibly high gondola called Strawberry all the way up the left side of the mountain, which was sick as hell. We rode that a few times, and I saw the most absolutely incredible view I think there is in the States. Took a ton of pictures there with Dad.

The way down had nice paths for C and some really fun deep runs on the edges for me and Dad. Glad to go through all that with them. It was truly something. Then we made our way back after taking the last gondola up to finish out the day on an exceptional point prior to the light cruise back to the car.

After we left (I did one more on the fresh powder with the last stamina of the group), we drove back through some awesome road areas between the mountains next to the train freight lines. We saw two awesome long locomotive haulers coming by, and I was surprised to see the area named Taggart. We stopped just before a tunnel there to get a bite to eat at the Taggart Grill.

This was a fun spot off the highway, and I finally enjoyed some delicious halibut I'd been starving for. It came with potatoes au gratin, which apparently has cheese. We had a big laugh over it when I ate them all and only _then_ did everyone let me know that little non-English fact!

#### Friday: Snowbird

So this was our last day, and it was quite eventful to say the least. Spoiler: I have to kind of mention that Christopher did a full collarbone jump into the ground at one point! Anyway, started off with our traditional yummy breakfast, and man those berries just keep getting better and better.

Now that I'm home, it's literally mouthwatering to think about them, and frankly I'm going to need to take a second to brush my teeth just to get my mind off them. They were raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries as far as the eye could see. Man, I **cannot wait** to be rich enough to eat that yummy combo every single day I desire in the abundance found here![^co]

[^co]: I get them at Costco every chance I have, but this was just unbelievable. If I was making the frequent trips required for something like this, I'd seriously be spending $40/day in berries! While that might not be much in the future, it's material enough-ish now, as I'm really just trying to get everything flowing because I just want to sincerely get it all right in a longstanding system that actually reliably protects and connects investors.

Anyway, the iconic tram up was incredible, as always! It was Christopher's first time there, so I quickly took him to the special tunnel carpet. Dad waited from above and perched down some sick runs at the front.

Overall, an amazing mountain as always, especially since they just opened the backside. Fun to go in the bowls, but the real draw for me were the huge runs across the front left and right. With less time, I got to make an insane transition over from skier's left to the right by going over a literal mountain peak double-black!

That was a pretty damn crazy view and feeling when I was at the top of two mountain peaks, looking down onto both sides of the resort before jumping into the left. The drop there and around some other places was actually crazy! Reminded me of that deep one the day before where a guy got stuck in a tree. Literally, one of his skis wouldn't come out of the branches and he was facing straight down the hill. His buds far below were never going to get him on that double black, so I released him and he was saved—yay!

I knew that was a pivotal point in the peak execution where I stopped waiting on or living in the past. It feels incredible to now know that everything truly, honestly really is right here in front of me. And dang am I happy to keep bringing this new financial system to a world that so desperately needs decentralization as the lifeblood of newfound innovation. Innovation that does more than serve as a source of everyone's retirement portfolio, acting rather first and foremost for the markets themselves which feed their specialized profits.

#### Saturday: Return

Everyone was nice to bring me to the airport with my veggie omelet in-hand via C's generous to-go box! Had a nice flight back and even went to the lounge for one last time in Dallas. I'm done with those handout crap things and all the associated burdens, because frankly I have absolutely damn plenty to make it with what I own.

Perhaps we're at the start of a big shift, and I know the marketable consequences in relation to today's price level. But to be honest, nobody is going to care once everything gets debased. I just know we need so dearly that true savior of a functioning system devoid of these central middlemen.

Anyway, lots of good audiobooks on the way back, and finished most of _Bureaucratic Politics and Regulatory Reform: The EPA and Emissions Trading_. Have a note from there to work into some things, which will be good. Really appreciating the recent move towards a more stoic interpretation of life events.

K was super happy to see me back, and the drive home was really nice, getting to hear about how everything went for her the last week. She had a tough time when I was gone, which I notice is a common thing for her, probably because frankly there aren't any people (nonetheless girls) her age out here aside from maybe one person at work. It's a little sad, and I am thankful for the chance to lift us up out of this isolation (and her from the demands of labor) so that we can all succeed in a social abundance where she'll flourish.

## New Week

### Sunday Party

This was a really nice relaxing day of pleasure with K. Firstly, we made a super cool awesome snowman **with a real carrot!** Gosh, I've honestly never done that before, at least in terms of anything I can recall. That one image with Mom as a kid comes to mind :)

Really happy to have a fun day that doesn't exert me to the limits, which is frankly something K is exceptionally good at. She was so sweet coming up with her own date idea for when I got back to go back to the gaming pinball place and then enjoy a tasty Korean BBQ. Can't wait to have fun with her doing such in the immediate weekend, as we prep for her very special birthday and V-Day.

Sometimes I think Corey would puke at a few things I do, but I really try to balance everything exceptionally. But at a certain point, I just don't give a damn. I mean, if I really want to fucking do something for her, then let's make it happen, because why the fuck not. And I love that I have the freedom to do things like that now.

We even got to do a whole Mario Party before some more work with LEGOs and painting fun. And what an awesome salad she makes. I'm very thankful she's in my world to make it fun.

### Monday Active!

This was a very exciting day getting back to dozens of recent GitHub notices from the Stellar side. It was super nice to see so much attention from what has otherwise been a desolate, isolated group of core devs. They're moving some of the things into some kind of spreadsheet for their own internal organization, which I guess is interesting because now I can see what a more centralized management approach looks like.

Felt good to get back on the same page with everyone and hit the ground running. I'm so very thankful, in a completely new light after the liquidity args, to have this incredible community that truly understands what's going on in the markets. I truly can't wait to send the shares their way and deploy that management by the main DAO structures they were pioneers to bring into place on the retail front years ago.

Fun daily finale after setting up some logistics: I clogged the toilet with a big :poop:! Lol, that was crazy, and man it just wouldn't come out with the plunger. I felt so fucking amazing when I managed to wring it down with soap and boiling water, like seriously I was ecstatic after hours and hours of attempts!

### Today! :)

After that win, I finally got some time to reflect, which I am so thankful for. I might be ignoring some relatively serious centralized working obligations on the ABS stuff, but honestly, who fucking cares. This decentralized approach is just so, so much better, and I really can't wait to share it with more people so that they too can free themselves from the shackles of coercive command.

The recent chats have been nothing but action-oriented, as is the nature of GitHub itself, and that is so cool! I really finally feel like we're all making progress towards our best next state. And it's all thanks to the incredible central work of the new GitHub team which was seeded in the decentralized and open-source roots of the original platform so steadfastly developed.

Love doers, so happy they exist. Really can't thank them enough for all this nuanced work that I truly have zero intention of focusing my energies on, because frankly it just drains me. I have finally gotten used to the vegetable of writing, and I really know that it's my true unique ability, as Dan Sullivan would put it.

Man, I appreciated that endorsement he gave me on LinkedIn skills all those years back. I don't even feature it today because I'm locked out of the account by my own design, since centralized crap is just not worth it. But man, when I was a kid, him and Cormac giving me their vote of confidence was absolutely breathtaking and so damn key to my own personal confidence to venture out on my own.

Thanks 🌌
