## Choosing Abundance Cont'd

I've been staring out at a gorgeous snowy afternoon today. It's been nice enjoying Connersville as a small place where the noise of physical decentralization dare not impede a more traditionalist life. Personally, I still prefer the subways and the dense efficiencies of locale. But this place has been nice, giving me a feel and outlook more aligned with the masses, so to speak.

My snowman kind of fell, but I've still got those huge balls we made together anchoring alongside the tree. Those chains are still swinging from an old swing or something. I vow to break them one way or another by the time I leave here.

### Kayla

I've had some time with the cutie as she got her nails done in a super special red-pink-gold decorated art diamond magic... It was really something, and it seemed to make her so happy. A while back she said that all the other girls always had their nails painted when she was in middle school, making her feel envious.

I hope she finds what she's looking for when and as she goes on these beautification journeys.

I've been going back and forth between that Ken Ashcorp lyric lately: A girl's worth is measured by her denier. Interesting to compare this modern stance with the historic use of women as social capital bargaining and property chips.

### Masculine and Feminine Stances

Along those lines (albeit quite loosely and irrelevantly), I've been thinking about what I'd like everything to look like once she doesn't need to work anymore. One key aspect is travel planning, something I have spent quite a considerable amount of time on in the past. I don't like it one bit over traditional work, and K seems happy to do so.

But when it happens, I can see her going into a relatively masculine state. She gets all short and testing-ish.

I try so hard to give people the leeway to fail, but on sizable things like a luxury hotel, it can be challenging to bite my tongue when I see very plainly that ten minutes of research would save material sums. But of course, this is the trade-off of letting others do things and make mistakes.

I know I need to let them fail and learn on their own for longstanding effectiveness. I just hope that she will be able to deal with these arrangements as the years go by. It's a big load off me when I don't need to waste around making familial plans when I ought to be at work. I just don't want to throw too much on her to the point where she feels like "a man" doing too much planning work.

I'm learning to reach out and trust people. This extra hotel along the trip was her idea, and she took ownership of it from the start. That's the kind of environment I want to foster and grow, because I think it lets her stay in the isolated feminine frame while still taking material actions towards common pleasures.

### Gender Incentives

I've just thought and seen too much of that housewife bitch who just spends the money and on and on. I'm very thankful Kayla isn't like that. I mean we're literally spending her money and she still consults me deeply on these things, including with deference. I'm just thankful to be able to keep everything above water and joyous for us.

She's good, and I'm thankful we have each other. I appreciate her soft touch every morning, and how she always squeezes me in our slumbers. We've got a fun trip to look forward to now that she's configuring each item, and I really appreciate that. Sometimes the pressure of organizing everything can get insurmountable upon choice resistance. Hopefully I can help remove this from her by not questioning any of the things we do and by acting like a man wherever we go. That means abundance at restaurants, and open play for any shopping excursions.

Ahh great, now I feel like one of those ass old guys buying their wife a ton of crap. But she does the same for me. It's a hard, weird feeling, and I just want to enjoy it with my time we have together.

What I should really do is chat with Corey Wayne one of these days. A coach like that could save me the hours of ruminating on these items myself and without as much experience. I wish there were coaches like that in the main work items I strive towards. But at least these simple earthly things ought do.

I just want things to work out well for everyone, and I know that means less time to reflect or interact with the community. At least, in principle, every second away from the direct work items touches a mass of unhelped investors. It's my grateful responsibility to get this right for them in the next four years.

Well then, now it is. The goal is so clear now. I see the path laying right ahead.
