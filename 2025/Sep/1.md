Yay happy Labor Day! Today K had off and went into mega ball cuddle mode around the house lol! Plus some fun gaming in her extra room.

This last weekend was pretty intense. And the whole prior week since last reflecting has been a lot based on live WhyDRS chats. I even popped into some MLP community calls to cope with things pretty early into the morning.

I'm thankful for the incredible artists there and their inspiring work. And I am also coming to terms with the growing responsibilities I now shoulder. One reason the weekend was really hard was because I had to embrace and process these commitments.

By steering myself away from live chats, I'm bringing my mental energy consumption back into control. That's been nice because it's helped me relatively stabilize my diet. I went far too hard into extreme carb territory for four days and I'm just now recovering from the tail end of it.

I appreciate that I understand just how important my food intake is, as I'm really feeling the brunt of total improductivity these last many hours. I also really appreciate that K does well and we can afford all the food we need. I am coming to terms with our living situation and I think it's doing well to substantiate interpretations of social policy on global workforce.

I wish I had some more thorough documentation like this early on, because I am particularly curious about the base motivations when possible combined with stimulus incentive regularly. A lot of nuance there was the level of central control. I think I'll develop a much better grasp as I open source the docs.

All I know is that I have a much better understanding of mental load implicated in my work. I can judge my status and fuel levels, and I've been trying to adjust intake as much as my stomach will let me consume. The most exciting work also takes a whole lot of energy, and I really can't wait until we have the bandwidth to go full keto again for maximum work prioritization. I just love decentralization so much and want to make it the norm. And I'm glad we got the sentimental dialogue thoughts doc'd down for the community show.

I appreciate this opportunity to see what challenging times feel like together. I love my friends that helped so much year after year. I'm doing well and I just want to get everyone on board.

Kayla took us out to the dinosaurs children's museum on Saturday. We had a great time seeing all the gadgets and art. It had a cool outdoors area and fun food court.

After that we went to a special Ethiopian restaurant. Kayla was so excited for the traditional coffee and popcorn. I'm trying to balance my stimulants because I tend to think it manifests in centralization of work-product output.

Definitely explored that a lot and wish it into more working products.
