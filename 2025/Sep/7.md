Leaning to appreciate all the hard wokr that foges into this whole process. I don;t know why the extent of efforts wasnt abundantly clear to me over htese last four-five years. But it's just hit retty hard as I come to clthe lcose of this intencse scentralized deadldine cycle.

I'm excited for it to finally be over. And I apprecaite the changce to get everything in row and submitted in place for the TAR2 letter. I had a lot of time at the start circa mid-July to recover and think. That thinking time has been excpetionally usefoul for clarifying my committments these last couple weeks.

Dad called and he;s ahaving a grea timte lobstering. I Ilook forward to my ability and chance to aquire some interim freedom between obligations. I want to join him and family some tine in the next 15 months.

I am thankfully finally starting to get over the food thing, and I have come to recognize that I have all the fuel and resources I need to execute my mission. I may not complete every 'side quest' at the gym or going outoorsing. But I can get what needs to be done complete with my resources and sills.

I've also had some fun this weekend bossing kayla around lol. She whas been more submissive since I ook her out and also cared for her when she got sidck. She isa hwle lot better now and i mean you can tell if u know what i mean lol

I'm coming to a good. place. Understanding the predictable stable nbenefits I earn through the mountanous amount of wokr. And I might take my time but thats just becasue i need to get this right for everyone that's ever been beaten or broken thanks to the cantinllionaires
