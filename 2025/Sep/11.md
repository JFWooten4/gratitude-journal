Tired but I got a few moments. Everything is just like wow a wow. I am so thankful I didn't complicate myself in any of the Meridian crap because I am just completely at my bandwidth on the Examination reply.

I went over all the things I've been doing this last month as mental prep. I have spent my time incredibly wisely dealing with every material narrative point needed to think clearly. Now I'm in a final phase and cut against it all to end execution.

I've come to the conclusion that there's just nothing I'm going to be able to change at this point life-wise. I am over and done with not trading Kayla's money. And that is a nice freeing feeling.

I'm moving it all back to her main account as asked and then I will finally be the only and best shot we ever have at success. It hurts to know I will leave behind solid compounding investments, but it's only like a few million at most without credence. I've given up on paths far larger than that before out of principle.

And principle I am thankful to have. What's the Rand thing? Try making steel with weak principles or values I think lol.

Trust me, I have got who I am down pat. I know exactly what needs to happen and there is nothing you can fucking do to slow me down, aside from starve the community of capital lol. No but seriously we are gonna get that funding one way or another and make things work.

I know we can do it. We have every path to make it happen. And I know things will get easier once we iron out all the conflicts with strongest governance of any DAO.

We have such an incredibly unique opportunity to develop all this from a tiny little seed into a global standard. And that infrastructure will be one of the best things ever to happen in finance because it is and will be just about the only tooling built by and for the people with and alongside the regulators. I want to get this right so badly to protect the American public—no I need to get it right.

I came to the conclusion today on one of three manic walks that people will die if we don't stop their artificial collapse. Maybe it's just the day, but I have this unbending feeling that we need to protect society from their failure or else it's permanent slavery and war ad infinitum. We're going to fix this with the network because there's no other fucking option—live or die for practically all.

I wish I could keep writing all night. I am sacrificing every ounce of health to get this in on time, and I just pray I have time for submission by EOD with a PDF compilation. I really really believe it can be done using the same (and final) means applied to TAR1 per technical compilation.

I need to practice restraint. I've been listening to Flawless (Sparklemoon you goons) for my entire adrenaline daily playlist, and I need to exercise similar skill here. I can only publish just the inquisitive base to require more thorough FAC contemplation.
