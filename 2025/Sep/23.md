Still hard to type, but the audio transcription isn’t doing it anymore. Big procedural changes today, deprecating the 723 central backref in deference to community efforts for TAR2. I think I achieved 80% of my community points in §4 and the setup there in Response 8.

I probably won’t have time to check back in here until the weekend. Hopefully by then things will be better. Kayla joked like, lol, “I didn’t even make you wait a full week” to go back to work.

I appreciate the confidence and opportunity I have to shoot my shot in the community and finally with the Foundation. I want to go fast with the NGQ work.

Close to getting into it… but I needed to close off my past bridges. Within a month I will have expiration of `securitization` and `hypothecations`.info, which deprecates the last nonessential centralized aspect of chain scanning.

Not sure how things will progress with the RPC changes, as it could carve a big moat alongside a no-action. I am anticipating and excited for bringing on more people that specialize in that work soon.

Free from Commission and in a 20-month track to review perfection (kergal). I hope they’re excited for the show.
