stil  hard to t ype,  but  ht e aidio  trnascirption isnt doing it anymore. big proccedural changers  todya, deprecating  the  723  centrla backref in deference  to community  efforts for tar2. i think i achieved 80% of my community p oints in ยง 4 and setup there in Respnse 8

i probwbly  wont  have  time to ccheck back in here  until the weekend. hpoefully by  then things we il l be better/ kaylka joked like lol 'i didn;t even  make you wait a  full  week" to go  back to0 work

i apperc8iat ethe confidence and opporiuntiyt i have to shoot my  shot in the communitty and  finally iwht the foundation. jjjjjjwant to  go fast with the  nqg work

close to  getting into it,.. but  ineeded to close  off my past  bridges. within a mnth i wiwll have  epxieraiton of `securitzation` andd `hypothecations`.info, which deprecates the las nonexssential centralizedd aspect pf cchain scanning

\ not sure how things will provfess with  the rpc changes, as it ccould carve  a  big moat alongside a no-acctioon. i am anticipating and acited for bringing on more pople that  speccialize ier nthat work son

free from Commission and in 20-mo  track to review perfection (kergal).  i hope theiy 're  excited for tge show \
