Doin better, still adjusting to higher household loads. We went to the coffee spot in Liberty she's been eyeing for so long. It was fun and a nice quaint town.

Then I had a choice to make in re commitment to next week's work. But really it was whether I dedicated my time to health over raw working output. We had a nice time with tea and her pastries in the shop and around the town.

After enjoying a moment in the pavilion, I kept us going on a long run to Costco. We got a lot of food, and I know everything will help fuel me (and her). She was particularly excited about this big stuffed bear llama thing she named Larry.

I wish I had the free-caringness to get nice funs like that on an impulse. I think things are better in the sense that I'm fueling not drained from our interactions. But it's still challenging when there's a lot of sensory stimulation like driving and talking or music at the Outback she finally got to take me to.

I most enjoyed our stop in the nearby town park and recreation trail around the pond. We walked on it for a while before exploring the nice fun rock and flower garden. Before that, we played a fun game of catch while I teased her a little based on my apparent softball skills.

I know she wouldn't have played forever, so I'm glad she made the choice for herself when coaching wouldn't. Wish I got to see her play a game growing up. I had a lot of pride back then, and mainly I was so concerned over getting everything right in the relationship.

Well here I am, everything right and myself as Mr. Right. It doesn't really feel all that high up like framing out to be. And I guess that's okay, or at least that's the narrative I choose to weave in for myself.

It's time to ease away from that attention drain anyway to focus on the mission. I know it's not as sexy, but I am able and damn willing to pursue it in this condition. To change course now would needlessly delay it all, and the logistics for Autumn have just been too much.

It was a lot to process, but I think I will soon walk into my full light in the fandom. It's exceptional to have friends to chat with who produce such incredible work. I want and choose to stay at it, keep making those friends.

I'll find a few of them and keep it tight. I don't have the time or bandwidth to give everything to all of them. Last night was the big end I believe to a lot of the less informed relationships.

It's just not super exciting or fun talking to basic forum, although I have had a really fkn awesome time learning about everyone's direct online relationships these last weeks. It's incredible fodder for writing inspiration. Writing which I'd like to uniform back into my chief persona because upon further reflection it's just not particularly worth segmenting out certain professional (which I'd consider my whole identity) pubs.
