It was a big, huge, massive (pick one lol) day for work, but it came with equivalent personal costs. It's been like this for some time, and I appreciate the exceptional week.

I know I can make things anew because I deserve happiness.

I'm thankful for 6days into that led to reconnecting with parent pay author. ASBT sick as fuck, and I'm pumped to chat with them next week. And hey, my arm is 90% better!!!!! 🦾
