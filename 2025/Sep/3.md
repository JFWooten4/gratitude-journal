I should really go back to working on the SEC back-and-forth, as we're approaching some of the initial final stages. I appreciate that we have this as an establishing work roadmap for continuing upgrades not already in the roadmap. And it's cool that I get to discover our path myself at the behest of the market, to the extent we can call regulators a market consuming compliant accounting goods.

The anecdote might be off, but I do know that it's helped me through a lot of growth lately. I've just been waiting so long for a chance to finally prove myself to them, and it feels good to nearly be out onto the other side. I also chose to stay home from the pony con this week to focus on finishing it out with max strength.

That worked out well because Kayla caught some cold or something from the kids at the museum, she thinks. She was crazy hot all day yesterday until she came home absolutely freezing cold. Poor girl, I made her chicken soup for days and she rested on the couch, but she didn't have any days-off bandwidth at work to take a single sick day.

I know I have a kinda different style of how I work than most. And I appreciate the freedom it normally gives me to pursue things more independently than needing to coordinate with an entire team. That just takes a lot of draining social interaction which I saw in the early days manually going through partnerships and clients to the behest of my creativity.

But at the same time, there's a real need to sculpt work around market demands at risk of failing to commercialize sufficiently to allow sustainability. I was informed today of AnimatedJames' stint with homelessness during Covid, and I found that quite crazy. So much incredible art in the world completely starved of charitable capital contributions for no good reason.

I just know we can all thrive so much better in a more giving economy. One where we can assume good faith and allow working items without forced central deadlines and statutory orders controlling fundamentally misguided groups. It requires a complete rethink of organizational affiliation, moving away from the status quo of needing central labor "to eat."

It's not about—

Crap well there I go making this a whole big thought process about giving people incentive and internal drive to work outside of tight capital controls. The whole thing could be a `micro`, and I wonder if I have other journal entries like this. I know some are voluminous, but they are intended for a less perceiving public viewpoint.

Even then, this whole thing could trivially become a micro site deployed like a blog.

Gah, I just am never done it feels like. And that's what I've been wrestling with lately as I face the commitment to marriage. It's something I had to contend with years strong and past with choosing Stellar as the sole chain to implement TAD3. And I always had it present with the administrative SEC relationship.

Just like it was a process to close out alternative doors with the network, it has been eight months strong of feeling personal challenges as long work hours clash with Kayla's horrible second-shift schedule.

I think I'm coming to terms with things. And I'm ready to let go of fear and give it a shot. I just don't see a single other path forward.

Part of it has been just the sheer amount of time I've poured into my goals. Waiting to move forward and hitting massive personal social walls during expansion. It's just been so much even though...

I'll go through all these lingering thoughts soon, once things calm down and I get work back to SDF. The point of my starting escapade is that it's a very small but (for me at least) critically meaningful distinction between free work and imposed standards. The simple deadline for this Response has completely shifted my thinking to the due date as an anchor point.

It brings me back to performative schooling where deadlines carried so much weight and I was great at handling them back then. But I was a different person vehemently conforming to "the system" then, and now I have so much experience acting with strength and independence with my own capital. And that has put my sense of dealing with the bullshit of overhead management skills down to practically nil.

I don't know how or if the SEC relationship will ever change, but I do know that this process got a lot of work off the table that will make it much easier going forward. I also know the requirements are quite slow to change if ever. And so I have at least some basis that we will not need to put forth so much in future interactions, and I can keep the interlay role under control without the endless nights again.

There's a special and direct feeling I get when doing the real intense work. It's a fragile state that takes a lot, and it's just so much harder to get there or maintain it when placed under external constraints for no real need. I'm thankful I get to perhaps change this culture through my own small corner of the world and its capital allocation.

Sometimes I wonder if we'll really do it. Achieve that swinging-chair thought. And what the vision will even look like when the time comes.

I know I've given up a lot in personal gain terms. And I can accept that as long as the community and projects receive the success. I just really appreciate my ability to stick with forward items despite this void of food, friends, or fun.
