Started going on the mateiral work today now hat I have the narrative figured out. Or lol I guess its the part you can see. Thats the thing with these dealines, they forntload so much mental work ...

Anyway I jsut wnated to dorp i an say thanks to my self i guess for embracing comittmne.t I made a tough choice not going to Mair Fare (lol that pselling tho) and I jus t had my last couple hours here processing that with Discord fam. Its a group of people Im thankful for but realize it just isnt helping me get to my objectives

I appracite that i can step back an see the socializing as something that really unfortunately does not fuel me. It came only from my own overexertion. And I see that I need to disconnect form this excess sitmulation to stay hte course

I do want social committments amongst close firends. But I recognize that I can;t actively seek and forge those relationships. I just need to keep my headdowna and let things develop themselves.

I've given up my hopes of eve going back into trading, because the systems design just matters too much. And I;ve seen today with Brnson's new launch that the vision will alwyas be at stake. I want to maintain mym own credible voice to rpotect our jsut deentraliation pinciples (inter alia) no matter the perosnal cost

I guess alos thanks to tamers for dropping something so fdifferent today. In the watch party I really saw through my own eyes just how nonadditive this has been in my life. I am lad for the fun gand games I go to enjoy , especially alongside family, but I understadn it;s jsut depriving my crucial reserves for fruitless personal hedonics ‚úåüèº
