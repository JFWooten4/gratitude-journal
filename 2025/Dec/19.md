Ya know I cherish so very much the memory from Ciderfest of dancing with Antonymph Fluttershy. They were so amazing and freeing in a kind of fun way I just haven't let myself experience in so many years. I'm so thankful I found myself again and get to pursue the things that make me really happy umu.
