You know, it's funny. For the longest time I wanted to have an SDF legacy-style golden-art clip traced profile banner for X and the other things, and man, fuck, now the only thing I want in life is to get a really sick-ass Shining-Armor length horn commission of Windsor for GitHub, and it just fills me with so much happiness and joy. Holy moly. I really absolutely love decentralization.
