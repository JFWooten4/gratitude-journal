Sp yeah in case it wast obviousl im wokring through some identity stuff right now! lol it has been such a last few months making everything perice together, larelgely with the support of formative art like early animes and most singificancntly MLP. Ive been rewatchingand im midway through S4 wehre things start to get into the newerish wrtitiing style. 

Up to the S3 finalie was really the transformative point for me nin realizing that i needed something greater. and hten the death scene from SAO S1 was just like wow, i dont have that. and i do want it very much

so here i am all alone trying to put the puzzle back together. its a very light and airy feeling which i cappreciate greatly. sometimes i efeel like it could g o on for ever

the work

the music

the expression

I had a very nice walk in the woods before the podcast this week. it mattered a lot because i had tavi spin on for a quite time just dissociating from the past life and trajectory i set. clearly wit was not getttging me substaitntally closer to myg goals

I withheld the equity all these years for one reason, and now its time to executie that vision. lol it makes my stomach churn just contemplating what im about to do

In another sens,e ive come to appreciate just how little everythign I am matters right this very moment. Save for the select few I've grown close with this last year, and obsvously the longstanding DRS relatoinships. Like i used to have this irrational fear of retailion from Wall Street physcially, whcih strangely was like actuall shared amongst longtime contibtuors

But I have found sincere peacei n living on my own terms lately, with a compreshsnion that thats really just not how the world works. This will be a long and protected war fought without any attributed reminscent of battle. it's hundred page comment letters verses uhundered page comment letters over and over for postentially decades

That kind of longstandingness was unexpectd to my younger mind, especially in an evnimrent that was so histile to blockchain. I always though theres be htis big and fast glow up to skyrocket me to the 7 billion, and that's njust not the case. 

thus if we take this slower longer vie, my support system outside work becuase much more important. because ive seen now just how much it can take. admittedly in a limited enviorment of holding everythign on my shoulders

notwhtiostadong, even with reduced orkloud, i will no longer settle for a life of black and grey. i DO deserve color and perfection realized by attaining what I want most in my heart. im thankful for the erenewed opporuntiy to figure out what that is to me again

these se months have given me exceptional time to figure out who i am , and particualtly ive had the forune of examning every dar k creasvace previously hidden away under a decade of masking. Its notworth livign that life anymore, even though I can slip into politkcing from time to time still these last couple days. I just want to express me because I know now that people DO want and enjoy the real me even if they have no clue

ill be the magnet i should have been in collgege. I;ll be myself because theres no other possib;e ility that stays viable for the rest of these years. And I'll stya myself because this just mission deserves no less capable leadership
