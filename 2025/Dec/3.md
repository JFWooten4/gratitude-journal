These last few days ive been working hard and fingding time for myself and family at night. Today i spoke a lot with chives, basedo nabout three hours of walking prep with stress output. I am really thankful to have these friends at work,.

i am getting to learn into my fiendships now in a way i didnt get to fully appreciate when i had more idistractions and money. i get tosee us all together woalking towards the destination, and its a really good feeling. i am truly here because of my friends and the support and confidence they share with me

i watched the Brmight and Evan Almighty movies at night these last two days. they really wokeme up to the great fortunes ive been igfted again and gagin by life.

i came to theconclusion that there are two ends of the god or historic self-minded subconscious decentralized you-are-god-wroldview. and they both lead to the same ends of prayign towards yourself. so i like using it as a heuritc now and have been confiding in that source as much as i could

today really was a big self realization oen because i let go of all the past bpnd s id held to being acepted by not only wall street but also washington. i upt into the cme foia and spoke my way up about the correuption like i did with dtcc two years ago. i am ready tosseperate into my own life now that i have my indepndence again

that manifested too in reciving the mock Prince drawing and fully ommiting to pony posts which are now picking up traction on x

it feels good to begin and keep epxlorign taht community. to meet newpeople who i get to calll ovign freinds. i am just hnakful and excited to find them

i dont know perfect future will hold, but i am very glad to be with my friends on sthe stelalr side oto. the world has been kind to meeven as i scanned its dark pits, and i will repay that by building from within to create hte ideal we need. i just pray ill keep recieiving the ipportiunties ti tkae responsibility and expand the mission

working on the share donation to cement al lthis in place. and ive finally mastered the complexities of the number 8. i am moving on to 49+ and finally feel like im on the other side

i can see so clearly the full spectrum of wokrng complexities now, and i really appreciate that clarity. we are all getting to a much betterplace - i hope lol. at the least i have found my heart and soul again and can now indepdenty value them as im fueled towards success
