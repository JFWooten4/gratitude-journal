OK so some things happening here lol.

Firstly, this is my first entry in DVORAK!

I think I'm coming along pretty well. The hardest key has been "S" because of all those years learning WASD.

But it has made my writing very concise since it's so hard to write? LOL.

Also just got back from Swiss ski trip with Dad. Really didn't think I'd go until everything happened.

It gave me a lot of time away from work to think about things. That was nice. I am thankful for my resolve to learn this layout early on in life so that I can do and be more >.< ! 

I'll do the dump macro soon on paper.
