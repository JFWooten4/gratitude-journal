Whew that was quite the last week and a half. I am coming to appreciate again this place to write back how I did when it was still private. I have come to terms with things being public in all aspects, which I appreciate because it was not an easy thing to accept.

I'm excited and happy to get to collaborate with everyone through public forms like this because it's the only way to have a decentralized entity without controlling forum. Lol I guess those are backwards, and I am glad I have the wherewithal to notice that. It's been tough as I figure out what I need in solitude and space lately.

I hope that I can keep getting that from Kayla—I really do. I have a pony event staged for later this month if I can get things off on a roll the next weeks. I really hope I'll find some answers there that help clear my conscience.

I also get to circle around with some friends today around the closing working items for Wall St differentiation. I have been anticipating this for a long time and working on all these setup factors. It feels really good to finally shoot and walk past all that politicking.

Also very close to finishing up on the XLM side. It seems like I will need to take things by the horns. This will be the first time I really jump on the bull and steer direction there, and that's a big change of role I wasn't expecting tbh.

I've come to realize a lot when thinking about that, even though I know my immediate focus needs to be on the DUNA. It's a very centralized role that needs execution just right, and I feel guilty giving anything less than my constant all to perform around it. And don't give me that shit about flaming out, because you have no idea how fun the poly trading was if I just didn't have bullshit principle distractions.

I'm doing better glancing past my hatred for the old institutions. I am thinking happier thoughts, even if I can't shake the feeling of needing to be alone. I had problems way long back around personal life satisfaction, and that has never crossed my mind after figuring out my goals back at 16.

Also I keep making friends with trans girls, and I just want to say like lol so much fkn easier than real women. Like I just appreciate the upfrontness that doesn't leave me filtering every waking word through a bureaucratic process. And again I really appreciate this space to write out feelings that manically crowd my head when left unattended.

Just got back from a trip to Hilton Head, where the K family has a timeshare. I've been waiting to venture out here since first learning about it, but it was just really busy all these last years. Well now I finally go out there, and it was cool—really fun—to sit on the dock right by the house fishing.

I'm getting better at accepting nature and my own path of actions as a given course. I have learned to stop waiting for a double-check of natural principles—letting things flow freely and fall into placement. Still completely obsessed with the timing of number stamps, and they have been serving me really well these last months.

We saw her Dad, Grandpa, Mom, aunt, and some cousins. It was great hearing more about their stories from communist Vietnam, understanding how the government manipulated everything through their central control. I appreciate their perspective, and what a great opportunity to expand my horizons these last years chatting with all.

There's a lot to do now that I'm back, and I feel a lot better letting some of this out. Other times I turn to music which boosts my psyche and develops my subconscious. I have been doing really really well lately with picturing and bringing ideas into fruition by reality.

Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooook I miss that feeling of what happiness was like, and I hope I can find it soon. I've been recharging my batteries on X feeds full of ponies, which has been awesome and even led to some new friends. I'm going to bring more of that into my life with extreme caution because I'm hinging around very centralized relations at the moment.
