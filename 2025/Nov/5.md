I had a chat with Kayla about taking a break and some time alone, and things went really amicably. I am also learning to better write political things for friends. Bob brought up a very good point on some DTC lies, and I was able to shoot off a quick reply without spending an hour citing a ton of sources.

That is a big step for me, and I had little to no anger arise. I appreciate the progress I've been able to make on that front in ignoring the old bogus and such. I also got to go to the dentist today with her, and we are both feeling a lot better now.

The work is piling up, but I am doing better with limited periods of quiet. I appreciate all the pictures we have together and support I've received from DRS friends in working through this. It reminds me of the time I spent bitching about dropping out of college to become a train engineer.

I really do wonder what things would be like if I went down that route. Kayla was for all practical purposes the only thing that stopped it from happening, and led to my hunkering down for years at the expense of early TAD development work. I never felt like those last years were anything more than checking a bureaucratic box at the expense of my life and creativity.

Back then, I was just so curious as to what was out there, and I didn't want to miss out on any sort of "higher education" even though I'd already excelled in Masters-level courses. I spent so much time perusing the course catalog and diving into descriptions or syllabi to get a grip on what was possible to be taught. By the time I was at year 3, I suppose I wanted to wrap it away out of a sense of obligation to my family who had done so very much preparatory work to allow my attending college.

Also, InVenture was a really cool experience that gave me a lot of needed confidence before Cormac, and I felt a little indebted for that. So I suffered through that last year up to Dec 2022 while basically getting nothing of use, and I really do mean that compared to the earlier years. I just was not built to be that gigachad megabrain solo dev kinda thing, and I accepted that on my second attempt for integral calc to the detriment of market ambitions.

But now I'm in a centralized role that is all my own creation. And it is strictly _not_ necessary to the accomplishment of my mission, assuming even that it does not detract from my goal (which is mildly generous). I know love is important, and I don't want to fall into the devoid pit seen in Saylor.

I want to find it again someday, and I really have pause with my current moves. She just got me an awesome Dashie plush, and it was so so cute. I know that I love her but I just can't stand in this environment anymore, sort of like how it was way back then with my Mom (thanks for that mature perspective from experience btw <#)
