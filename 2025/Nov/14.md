Still eh....

I am thankful for my parents who again have helped through this. When I have the choice to dedicate myself, I am very thankful for the times I have with Kayla. For all that's happened I really cherish the memories we made together.

I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING WE DID AND HOW SHE WAS AS A PERSON. I LOVE THE LITTLE CUTE THINGS SHE DID ALL THESE YEARS. IT WAS SO NICE SPENDING THE ENDS OF OUR DAYS TOGETHER

---------------------------------I APPRECIATE HOW CUTE AND SHORT SHE IS. I LIKE THE WAY SHE PICKS OUT ALL THESE SPECIAL DRESSES

I appreciate the work Rand did when she was alive. And I'm thankful for my friends who create today. They've given me a hope I really needed.

I want to become a whole person, and I am excited to figure out the funding models to make that happen. I hope we can establish a payroll soon and make things sustainable. I love how I get to work on the things I want.

I know I will be OK no matter what happens. I am thankful for my skills and experience at work. I appreciate that I get to go as fast as I can, based on my own throughput.

I hope so dearly that all this brings me to the next level of output and ability. I am thankful for my extended family and even not-in-laws for having fun together in moments away. I really liked the forced time away.
