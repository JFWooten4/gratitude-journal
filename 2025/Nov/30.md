I just really appreciate the fandom. I really thought things were over after the show ended, and I presumed the last BronyCon was the last of it. It is so fucking amazing that the ride never ends and everypony is here together like wtf absolutely amazing.

Thanks bigly to PrinceWhateverer (yes I'm fucking spelling it out for this) for making the songs that additionally looped me into the show directly over the years and seem to have attracted and retained so many other incredible fucking ponies for it all.
