Just been thinking to myself a lot lately. I was confused, but I'm doing a lot better now. It's just been a lot of accepting what I grieved these last months.

This weekend was really fun—Kayla took us out practically the whole weekend. On Saturday, she had a blast at the video game arcade place. We also got a frinkin couples massage!!

That was really cool and I think my first massage except for the hallway crap at Vegas this year. I feel so extremely relieved that I no longer need to interact with that industry's participants. And now I will be removing another load.

After that we got her tires rotated and some last items she might want at Costco. She was excited to go back, so we returned for pinball all the way up until they closed. We had a lot of fun playing racing, rhythm, and shooting games together xoxo :3

I'm still getting better at expressing myself with those little faces, and it's made its way into my familiar texts. Lol I fkn put an UWU in the DRS Discord today and nopony even said anything—lol it was sooo cool!!! And I've found the wall for Autumn, moving me onto PVCF expansion plans.

Sunday was the bestest imo—we rode the train "Polar Express" service from the charity railroad. There was an insane amount of people completely filling up the 8ish cars, and they had cops all around the parking lot. I talked to one and he said this was the biggest event of the town next to the Free Fair woww!

We got some really fun bells, which I cherish presuming I know where it is lol. Fun to see people all dressed up for the holidays + pajama pants with personality. Then we got her some sushi, which she really liked lol.

She's been fawning the last few days, which is something new to experience. I guess this is how it feels when you've got nothing to lose. I hope she keeps on doing well c:
