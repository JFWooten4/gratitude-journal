It feels really good to know that I just have friends. You know like when you're constantly checking for new notifications affirming that your new friends respond to and acknowledge you? Well I think I'm finally past that point in the brony communities I've selected, and it feels really nice.

It was a weekend... lol. I have started expressing myself more in nonprofessional writings with text things that make me feel expressed uwu. It's nice and really good for someone like me who doesn't get out a lot with real friends to release emotions.

I guess I used to have Kayla for that side of me, but even then I never really let myself fall into the feminine. I guess I approached it like the business—everything had to be perfect and by the book. I've stepped out on a limb after the Review to move forward my way because it's the only sustainable path I can see that doesn't result in... that keeps my head clear.

I've come to greatly value my mental acuity these last couple years. It used to be so so easy, drop-dead simple. Idk if I've just gotten older or what, but now I need to be more careful.

Things I could tackle before—like politicking different relationships in the same day—just take it out of me now. I don't think it's my diet, as I've been getting that back under control. Although surely keto would help with throughput.

I think a big part of it is that there's just so much more going on in my mind now. Like I understand how old people can't move science forward, and they need to die off for the young theories to flourish. I have an immense set of preconditioned experiences and beliefs which display themselves in my working intuition.

That whole schema takes a lot to process. It feels like a balancing act between my body's energy sources. And I need someone who will help replenish the supply no matter what.

Last days have been something. I started off working on the DEX docs, and I'm happy to be on that again. I am so close to finishing things up.

But I realized that I needed to change the relationship to get into the right place for completion. How can I write about free markets when my own living situation traps me in conformity? I just anguished on it for so long without realizing that my environment was not conducive to my necessary expression.

I've only really felt the markets with intermediation. Sure, there are some select entrepreneurial endeavors over the years, but those still relied on centralized marketing. What I have now between all the orgs is possibly the closest I've ever gotten to the market, and I fucking love it.

It feels so incredible to touch the grass of a maturing field without anyone's permission. To access the seedlings and fruits of an entire industry without needing a single tractor. I feel like an eagle flying through the sky rather than a person soaring in the confines of a metal tube.

It's an incredible fleeting feeling. And I know what I must do to get more of it. I let Mom and Dad know on a conference call Friday that I'd be coming, and obviously I had the hastened decision predicated on travel arrangement certainty.

I've had the Nov 21 date highlighted in my calendar for c. a month, but it feels so different actually now approaching. My energy has been changing and Kayla picks it up really well because we are very synchronized. I'm going to miss her and I hope she finds what she's looking for in life.

Last thing I've noticed lately is that I'm slowly removing blockers to my efforts. It's become abundantly clear that certain mental roadblocks slowed down my ability to timely respond to material online communications. I believe this stems from the additional mental load I've taken on preprocessing narratives with Kayla. Her responses to unsavvy wording instilled a necessity for flawlessness which is a bar too high for immediate friends to effectively communicate in a timely manner.

Mom and Dad were really supportive throughout the whole weekend and in their offering of help—which was not entirely expected and so super very appreciated. Also we went horseback riding at the ranch, which was just absolutely awesome and really helped me get through processing the end of all this. Afterwards we enjoyed a drive by the alien winery grape farm with doggies before having a crab leg smorgasbord at a buffet in a Laurel hotel out of the way!
