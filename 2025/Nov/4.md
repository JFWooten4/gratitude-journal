a leot happening around me rihggt now. like im happy and htnakful for igthubalways showing ab lue icon on my incobox so i dont ave the direct abulity to know when new things come in, so that i can focuson wahtever im viewing. after makine a ruckus a month ago, ive also come to appreciae hte neighbors little cheers and such as they are happy and becoming themseles

im doing better at accepting people and i appreciate the view this whole situation has shared iwth me on changing people. it combined iwth me experineces of clas.ss operatnt condiioning and capital allocaiton. i need time to perfect those conepts, which thankfully per a call iht pa mlike ih ave 7 0 year lol. i appreciate that but also like imjust trying ot figure out my next stepped appraoch

it helps a lot that htere re cettain reliabiilies like this journal and the new relationship site. that has helped me a lot combined with talking to friends about what's going on and presuming love and ocmpassion. that's something iv'e found in spacdes iwht the bronieswhich hasj ust been really suer cool. i so look forward to seeing what that migh grow into.

i know ineed space andtime and indepnedence t solitude. i swear i will find everything possible and make peace. just had a vc with LRF and it is nice ot have poele that understand these mamouth pressuees to get the work done right


like i said with him, it's just been a lot more human interaction lately. and i know i need to keep oing tdown that road to propeorl decentralize and delegate. i am scared to take hte neded jump which keeps veering towards my own centralization of efforts away form her

its just im coming to relaize how hard i need to hit to penetrate fully.a and it's a bar i throught would be lower. i wish i had the ability to lift us both over together, but i just don't feel like i can afford the hesitation to slow things down for 'deadweight' (LRF coin)

I've spent tso many wras, and (lol i guess this was my ted talk portion0 i did so much to satisfy the needs of these netrencherd beuoracies. i properly idssociated form individual idnetiies and perspective/. but maybe i didn't realize just how important it would be for me to change those heads over time
