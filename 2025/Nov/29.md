It’s been a long time—although lol idk exactly when last reflection was. Long as in a week or so, nothing insane. I was looking over the old physical journals the other day and saw when I skipped _months_ of reflection at the start of polyphasic Uberman.

It was such a time back then. I think about how things would’ve been if I was rested enough to check back on WSB. How it could’ve worked out if I just accepted the rules of centralized asset management and let things go.

I can’t go back. I can never go back. Because they have kneecapped the price mechanism of global capitalism so far past the acceptable fulcrum.

I went to my first pony convention!!! OWO UWU. Teheheeee :)

I remember thinking about doing something like this growing up. I wanted to get a Dash fursuit for one of the last BronyCons. But when I saw the price tag I just couldn’t figure things out.

I’ve come a very long way since then, and perhaps most importantly I’ve comforted with my own self. When I moved out of the house, I left my dreaded hair gel—which was a really big step for me to start walking away from exterior politics. It hurt a lot when Kayla remarked how she preferred my hair gelled, but then again it was my own fault for starting the relationship off like that on our dates.

It’s been so many years of trying to perform for everyone else, and I can’t express just how amazing it felt to finally do things for myself for a change. This weekend of pone was literally unbelievable and life-changing. I have not felt myself in about eight years up until this convention.

I really appreciate that nothing has happened at work—like there have been no professional consequences to my embracing ponies. I have started noticing that I am adult enough to have influence now, and crucially that has finally crystallized into a stable unique presence which does not need to bend to social norms. That’s been pretty cool.

For instance, I was in Pony Town the other night (Thanksgiving actually after everyone went to bed, I was completely on rabies from the social stress and food intake). I met this girl and we started chatting on Discord until things escalated to ERP—which I have like never experienced before.

That was a really fun and cool time like holy shit I had no clue I could feel those sorts of feelings both (i) alone and (ii) by interacting with someone exclusively through text—like wtf? So summm yeah idk that was a nice nut tho xd.

On the first day of the con, I met with my roommates and Sea Wyvern and I went to the Wabi Bricks, which sells all the secondhand Legos. It was a really cool experience and I loved the trains and Star Wars. I got a Mandalorian minifigure and he got a bunch of instruction manuals.

The next day Friday was the really big day, and I wore the Hot Topic FiM shirt which was apparently very popular on Sunday later on. For the first half of the day, I went to a bunch of panels which were like actually fucking enjoyable and hilarious. Having done so many work conventions, I didn’t think something like this was possible so it was really an amazing breath of fresh air. Roommates were awesome and introduced me to a bunch of people, and then I met some amazing ones on my own.

I got to tip Track and Melody then, which led to meeting some of the cool people around them too. Idk about the latter but I am extremely happy with how the interactions went on the former. Throughout the weekend and here, I got a bunch of stickers which I’m putting on my water bottle and skiing helmet, and it looks awesome.

It feels really nice to walk around with the bottle knowing that it represents everything I love and feel good about inside. I was also at the con with a tote I painted in college carrying the little Dash plushie from Miniso. It was fun having them and gave me a friendly support vibe even when I was walking between things alone that really helped boost my confidence being in a public place.

Not like I needed it I thought! This was basically the first place I’ve ever been to where I was completely surrounded by people, but I literally couldn’t tell and felt great! Idk like every single person I met just made me feel better and added to me in a way that’s extremely unique in general environments.

Anyway, I dropped all those off in the room to change into my suit for the gala—where I was going for a take on Shining’s Canterlot wedding. I think it came out pretty cool, but lol most people probably just thought it was a nice suit. Anyway I got there and waited around a little while everyone got food and the jazz quartet did a really awesome job playing some exceptional remakes from the songs which were so fun!

Then a DJ came up and people started dancing and um… lol I just started dancing with random girls! Omg it was like so fun—hahaha I’ve never felt so free before! We’d just do some back and forth during random songs and then move around to other mares. It was a really cool feeling and led me to meet some really exceptional beauties.

That’s where I’ve found new fodder for the relational thoughts which will come across in the LGBT blog. It’s been a while since I had people look at me like that, and even intentionally getting physical with me later in the night. I’ll keep reflecting on it and bring things together there, because there are way more things I’m grateful for which are easier to write about rn.

After the gala, we jumped straight into Melody’s set, and he hit so fucking hard and amazing it was literally the greatest thing ever! He was kind enough to give me some CDs and sign ’em later—and some of those tracks popped off on the show this night. Omg it was fkn unbelievable how good it felt after that dance to completely freak out to this insane music which lately has felt so deeply bound to my soul’s desires.

I literally felt like a different person on the moon by the end of that set, it was so fkn cool. Gah and it was so fun headbanging right next to the stage!

Needless to say, I was hooked on the artists and stayed for the many acts that continued for the next six hours. This is when things started getting a little crazy, and overall it was a really fun time. I didn’t expect how much my body would hurt the next day from all that action LOL—and man did it just feel euphoric in the moment.

I appreciate that they gave out earplugs at the door because they were sorely needed! And yeah it was just amazing artist after amazing artist that night, and people absolutely loved it all.

After it ended deep into the morning, I couldn’t slow down—partly because I didn’t bring any blue-light glasses. Then I heard a group singing karaoke in the lobby and joined them. Omg I had no clue how amazingly insanely fun it was to do songs from the show and community like that.

I joined in on Kirin Tale which is absolutely fucking amazing, and all of a sudden I was re-enjoying music from my childhood that I’d listened to so very many times because of their incredible inspiring message. When I got the mic, I had them do _Light of Your Cutie Mark_ errr lol sry _Pony I Wanna Be_. I thought it was the Coloratura stage song in my head, but it was actually like the fkn perfect one in reality.

When I was singing my lungs out with unbelievably surprising passion, things really clicked that this was sincerely the piece I’d been ignoring and missing all these years. I think some tears came as I went into the third reprieve because that’s literally exactly how I felt my whole life until that weekend where I just got to unshamely and greedily be myself for the first time.

---

Eventually lobby security came and shut us down because I was insanely loud. But not before a number of bystanders got some videos, so definitely there are people out there with records of this all. Tehe I thought about that a lot, because even during the concert I had photos taken of me doing some pretty insane shit without my knowing, which have made it online.

And like, you know what like fuck you! I have gotten to the point that I now trust my instincts, and I am just like completely done dealing with things that piss me off. I used to go through everything to understand an opposing viewpoint fully, but notwithstanding it’s like not anymore man fuck you!

Sure yeah I am happy to go into debates about things and such. But it will all not be lapping up the bullshit spewed by Wall St another fucking second longer. They can shove it because I have better things to build that completely obviate their horseshit.

And so one thing I’ve thought about with political optics all these years is unflattering public displays. This was a relatively public event, in the sense that anyone could walk into the hotel lobby and walk around the open area where a lot of conversations happened.

In fact, one of the awesome new friends I made was prominently featured in the local news with many adoring photos of their cosplay. So to say this could’ve been a media event (shit, and may become one in the distant future) is really not an overstatement.

I tell you what, I appreciate that I am given independence and not recognized by anyone here. I say that like I’m some fucking big shot, but idk maybe that could happen one day. I’ve had this thing for a very long time where I concern over that Russian plant thing where they have a really hot woman target a successful guy.

I understand that there are edge cases where she will have a whole family with the dude other than gain political things and such. I am probably blowing it out of proportion, but like Elon Musk fkn tweeted about it so idk am I??? Anyway, I thought just having Kayla with an affirmed strong base would be the answer to that, but it was an exceptionally centralized viewpoint.

I guess, at a certain point based on the next Macro, I’ll just need to live with that as one of the many risks in life. And honestly I feel a lot better about that now knowing that for instance one of the girls I danced with fucking vibed insanely hard and literally cosplayed as Flawless. Like there is a level of bullshit detection you can perform within the fandom inasmuch as whether or not someone gets the slang and lingo—so at least that’s an easy red flag to identify.

And like not to go on too long about this, but I can combine that with my focus on red flags in a more pronounced way going forward. Perhaps just even observance of anything like that and care towards ensuring integrity can take me up a big step. Conscious effort should see past that deceit, fingers crossed.

Erhm yeah so the next day um a lot more awesome panels, although I slept in until 2pm so I missed a few tehe lol. Then there was another concert, which started just as awesome for many hours. I had a really good time jamming out.

I’ve particularly enjoyed dancing with my eyes closed, it feels connected to my subconscious and just lets me think without acknowledging anyone passively. Again with the ignoring cameras and just being unfiltered no matter the scene in the con—it just helps me to ignore the social (i) reactions and (ii) consensus / status quo of how everyone else is dancing—because I just want to express my own feelings in motion.

Later that night I went to the penthouse to do professional real staged karaoke and met one of my new friends. We set up to do a duo, but honestly my voice was completely shot still from the night before and I could barely speak. I saw a lot of fun people I met there and man idk I just haven’t really had friends (outside work baha) like in eight years basically, and man it just felt really really good to be there.

Sunday came after an extended night of partying with some of the last people awake. I loved peering into some of the Mare Fair dynamics and interpersonal stories. Even though I found some politics in this topic, it was all fun and games that still kept a smile on my face rather than anything too serious for equine horses.

So lol I got up at 1pm and went to some of the tail-end events of the show. That morning was the newlywed events at 1am which was fun, but absolutely nothing compared to the pony Mad Libs which was like 2am or something. This was separate from the lobby chatting with new older friends who’d been putting out anon art for literally over a decade, which I thought was cool—esp when combined with the insanely life plushes which sprouted out then.

Just as Mad Libs was really fun, I really enjoyed the singing songs panel where you filled things in from the first day. I didn’t realize just how amazing music was at mental simulation until then and also when I came listening to Vylet for that ERP. This last day, that culminated into con stories panel from some of the biggest names around—and btw the music thing is supported by Hill which was cool when giving it another listen moving out.

Then I went to dinner with all the DC bronies, and that was a ton of fun. I teased the lead guest fren about the Tamers’ interpretation of Braeburn (his husband) and had an absolute blast. The fren in the news shared sticker that reads “on top of the world” with care package and Apple Bottom, and that’s really how things felt as they finally died down in the end.

So thanks for that Charlie, because man it really was something. It was nice to talk and I will make true on my promise to get the payment systems streamlined, in time. The art here is just so exceptional that I can’t imagine a worthier cause of disintermediation.

So Thanksgiving was fun too. It’s nice to see family, and everyone is doing well. Lots of laughing and joy without the emotional baggage hanging around anymore.

Packing was good and fun—I guess to the extent a week of nothing is lol. It feels good to start putting the pieces of my life away in an organized place. I feel great being able to walk forward knowing I have less physical baggage tying me into place.

I just loaded up the car and drove it to the con. Then it was a straight shot home. I thought about doing a play on the TA-1 with all this going down, but I just don’t think that’s super appropriate given their confidence. They have been really nice, so I’ll return that for now, especially too because I just need time to rebuild my bandwidth.

I rekeyed my boards with (i) awesome new MLP base bar and Dash escape keys from the vendor hall—where btw I got some fkn sick as hell Flawless swag—and (ii) DVORAK. I will start transitioning Monday, which I’m excited for. I know it’ll take a while but there’s literally no reason to delay that change any longer. I’ve clearly seen how meaningful writing is in my career, and there’s no excuse to do it at half efficiency and with the pain in my left wrist. Idk but after that skateboarding fall it just hasn’t been great because that was the fucked up arm, and I don’t have like etc etc for hospital.

So yeah I am happy and doing well. Things are coming along and I like how it’s all going. Mom has been great and we had fun cooking “together” through our own things these last days. Chris and Christopher and Taylor are all doing really well too, and lol we’re having fun together and with Grandma and Grandpa.

It was fun decorating the tree and watching a little MLP and listening to really fun music on Thanksgiving to cope with the pressures. I really appreciate that I’ve found the things in life that can recharge me when I’m drained. It gives me much more conviction to pour it all into work knowing there are outlets to rejuvenate my spirits when I need support and reassurance.

Being able to go back to the gym every morning, I definitely feel too that I have more just in myself independently again. It’s nice to be strong here just with myself. I always felt like half of the masculine-feminine arc until I found again my love for the show, and that’s something that’s really so special to me now.

I have to also thank the intensity of the DEX documentation work, because without that—none of this would’ve happened. The SEC review primed the pump and got me to the breaking point, but it was the necessity of completing the DEX docs which pushed me over the edge. Once I realized that I couldn’t do what I needed to do (to get to my goals) with that surrounding, I was able to make the tough call with the most amount of clarity one has in something like this.

Since it was the first real relationship, idk it was hard. I hope it will get easier if this needs to happen again going forward. Idk I doubt it will so I’ve been a little guarded and distant from women lately, especially when they remind me of a draw back into politics of attraction and such—it’s just not like a big yay.

Like last night I went with Dad to the store to get the studio on Black Friday. We had a good time talking about his marriage stuff at lunch, while we charged the Tesla—which I thought was cool. Afterwards we went to a bar to meet up with some other friends, and there was a cool market outside.

I had fun walking around and then we chatted until his friends showed up and all had some beers. They were pretty old and I guess successful but like all I could do was retreat into my own mind and think about my plans and options for the future, where I felt embraced by people I actually like. Notwithstanding, I did notice myself having a little more sociable leeway even there with feminine energy in chance encounters like on the way to the water jug lol.

Anyway the bigger thing is we then drove to a party for GF friend family thing of Dad’s. There were about a dozen people there, and we had fun eating a bunch of steak and tasty veggies. I met her 19-yo daughter Sara who idk like yeah she was hot whoopie. My type? Lol not really.

No clues about the fandom or even esports, which was like damn. The world and even primal parts of me expect myself to rocket towards that, but like I just feel absolutely nothing and couldn’t care less looking back. It’s different and challenging/engaging-er in the moment when things are right there and so easy to grab. Idk it’s just like who tf cares like why does this (i) matter and (ii) need to take so much bleh.

Idk, I’m figuring things out. It’s like weird because people are just often (largely girls but also there was this business-major financial planner at Prudential who was the same way) insanely predictable based on their past and psyche, which can be relatively easily picked up quickly for non-complex people. And idk it’s just like (i) feels a little exploitive to bring someone like that into bed? (ii) not intellectually stimulating to continue requesting information and (iii) unprogressive towards my objectives to engage in such short-term behaviours. I want to build something real and, while I’m happy to entertain limited family requests, I need my own space and relationships to do so well.
