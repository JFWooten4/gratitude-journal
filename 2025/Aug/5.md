## 'gay'

One thing I don't feel I've been able to adequately express in my work are the nuances between masculinity and femininity. It's a really important play of the social politicking dynamics which emerges quite directly in inter-organizational relations. I have even some tangential issues pending for the matter in free-markets, but I don't feel comfortable fully exploring the topics there.

It's not just that I'd prefer my blog to have a focus on web3 infrastructure. It's genuinely a completely different side of me to dive into the emotional nuances. It's on the backburner of my efforts 80%+ of the time, and when it emerges that one fifth of the time, it's just a completely different experience.

Often when in that state, I'll use my well-known alt for read-only exploratory purposes. But by stumbling back into the fandom these last 10 months, I started intertwining the two. As I believe I established last night, I'm disentangling them to clear up my psyche, but again that is the point.

This is a very real and large part of my thinking process and I feel quite clouded when I can't express this side of me. For clarity, I am happily together with my female fiancée. But I find it relevant that I lost my virginity to a bi girl.

There's so much more I'd like to explore here. The interactions with Authumn were something really eye-opening because I just haven't felt that emotional connection to myself in so long. And it's really helped me in interpreting darkness as a motif of birth and the womb.

Idk if it's my personality or what, but I just find it challenging to relentlessly pursue one avenue without correspondingly scaling other aspects of my reality. This matters a lot to me and I've been trying to find the best way to express them without the upper-strings of professional entanglements. I don't want nor need anything else physically, and I'm really happy with how everything's going — it's just a different avenue of gender I find fascinating.

This made its way into a var change this morning when I realized last night how so many of the meaningful relations getting my work through are innately feminine personalities. And again as discussed to length, the market itself is extremely feminine. I think there's a lot more to uncover in applying masculinity through this frame.

I plan to directly apply the work to the DUNA framing of teamwork without dominance. And I suppose I'll use this as an avenue for output for the time being. As I adjust to the new sleeping routine, hopefully this side's thoughts will dwindle back a little bit so that I can focus on getting more delegatory work out.
