Getting used to renewed circadian cycles with adjusted bedtime. I think this'll be a lot more sustainable with new blood-sugar levels on perfecting diet. I'm finding at least half an hour minimum to do dishes every day.

I think if I get a tabletop washer I can reclaim some of that time and do some good protein cooks with reasonable carbs. I want to get back into stuff like quinoa but not quinoa because it can't handle the lectins. And I ran potatoes (+ sweet) early this weekend week to no benefit.

I'm glad I figured out this diet stuff early on. And I appreciate that I get this weird west-end of the eastern time zone to make bureaucratic scheduling easier. It's so refreshing to work with actual real-life people who want to get things right.

I reluctantly roped myself into a call Friday after getting a lot of the EDGAR (Next) setup done today for TA-1 and LYLR. I am really not sure where they will go, but I want to support them in all endeavors. I'm feeling the barred edge of Rand's self-interest argument as I approach five years on centering efforts on financial inclusion.

Also got a new Discord skin through BetterDiscord on the recommendation of seeing it in MLP side. I want/need to step away from that for now and find some healthier ways to deal with stress without screen. I went on a board ride and I've been on two this last week now, which is the most in at least 9 months.

Dealing with it all as straightforwardly as I can since these artificial limits of working on others' agendas are just dense. Luckily, we finally have everything set into place. I would never have suspected it would end up so spectacular when all this started back in early April.

And for what it's worth thanks to Stellar team for being patient on my PR LOL. They gave me some love in DMs — very minimal and expected bureaucratic style. I sorta appreciate the community there but also I really prefer the people I get to work with over their AMM farming ... etc. etc. other chain interpolations and presumptions.

I really liked the early days when the SDF site was a fricking awesome space map. And the diction was so much bolder. It was so very clearly saving the world through this important tool we call the financial system, and now it's all watered down to like this we don't want to be single-chain maxi crap.

Nah, fuck ’em. We’re gonna do this and I will make it punch hard in five years. I don't care how much it costs me to use my voice and bring it all to age.

For the beat and the broken.
