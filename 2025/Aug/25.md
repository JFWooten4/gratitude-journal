I did a good job today :) I acomplished a lot. Not everything, but a lot ! :)

There was a lotof really awesome community chatter. I am so happy to be in so many Discords because the differetn culturesb etween groups are extremely interesting. I aboslitely lvoe that we have small communtiies to work tiogether, because big beucracies suck! 

I also like that I can appreciate and ahchose to do enough. Like at the end of the day, I was irking over when I met Pierce staff three years ago, unable to find a public src URL. But then I remembered how much awesome dutllff I did todau and decided to just move on and check out ponies for 20mins incstead.

That was realiaxing. It was and is always fun to look at everyones' memes. And the pony ones are just so cute uwuwuwuwuwuwuwuw

So freshingto see all the feminine enrgy over there, with occasional spurts of altenratres. The ponies alone ugh just do so much talking. And the real ponies are just as incredivle lol

IM getting a better grip on my days now that I've minimized all human contat. I think there's still a good big pof progress to go with some more compatible earplugs. And I know new red glasses wuld help givne how long mine've been missing.

Things should start turning up next month, so I'll move donation budget from artists to essentials for a hot sec. That hould set me up until EoY :) The logistics are in place for some combined travels next year with K go tget mro erelaxing self-drected time at cons, and my wrk schedule will just have to deal with it!
