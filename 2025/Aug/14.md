Ohhh. Wooooooh. Just take a deep breath out....! :_)

Oohkahy. Man. I am doing well and okay and I am good and great yay!

Ah man. I don't even remember the last day I wrote in here and I do not care! It has been getting really close to burnout lately because I find myself performing work desired by others rather than my own creative intent.

I think that's totally fine if you put yourself out for it. Yay for bounties and specifically-commissioned art. Love the ability to just use this magic paper crap to transform human action.

But man do I get sick of it fast! I just appreciate the expansive view I have on capital from those formative years. People are way too caught up in it all lol.

I'm thankful for my ability to recognize when enough work is enough. I'm also (saltily lol) thankful for my unique ability to make things fill up to time allocated so as to achieve the best working product. I had some pretty crazy politicking choices today, for my last BS trip down the

Anyway I am glad all that is coming to an end. And I'm coming to like this being public repo. It helps me to become the kind of person I want to be.

Kayla came home from work for dinner today to chat around. I had finished for the day and was mellowing out on the couch. That was really fun and cool.

I'm thankful for the sound of her voice which always brings me down from whatever high work gets me into. It's been so super helpful lately when I've needed to ration my energy for lack of dense food. I guess I shouldn't be focusing on that here or elsewhere going forward because that is the way.

Yesterday ausiahfui dshfuids lol. Today I made that banana ice cream from the sorbet setting! I mixed in some frozen strawberries and it was really fun and good. K had bites with me and like yeah it was pretty awesome little treat together.

I don't know how but I'm so thankful that freezing stuff somehow makes it taste way better. It's been a huge help in filling myself with fats that are easy to take down. Oh and lol I still need to order exogenous ketones.

I promise I will, I just ne

Anyway,

These last few months I've felt pretty far away from home, but I came to realize in talks with K this week that I probably just need to spread my trust a little bit more. I've spent so much time fitting myself in everyone else's box it's just a little ridiculous. I'm thankful for my lack of institutional backing that gives me the freedom to voice every agenda item I like.

Seriously I would be living in a frantic hell if I had to keep at all this with the crazy oversight I felt from potential capital back in 22. I think there's like one podcast I've talked about it and frankly I try to blur it out of my memory. It just feels so good to voice my feelings vis-a-vis thoughts in the most direct way appropriate for forum and singular audience!
