I'm making good progress in compartmentalizing work and living in a tmeporary peace. I appreciate how well I did walking off some strong feeligns about recent DTC/DA changes. I see that the battle will take palce glacially slowly in the marketplace for offerings until their whole game comes cascading down.


K has been really great helping me take things ata my pace. I appreciate Vylet;'s work showing me the good and need and grow avaliable whne I trust my own conviction. I am aesepially thankful for trusting my isntincts when I start running out of steam.

Io'm thankful for my body and its hekpo ventuing into this world. I've asked a lot of it as of late and it's upoerb listening shows real localized ocntorl. That helps a lot hne im figuring out all these ,ovng targets.

This weekend K and I went to a fancy fubuggfet which was nice. She also mdae a delciious GF pasta cassarole. Ten we ot ot watch the new Bad Guys together.

I really appreciate her oing into the things I like together. I remember one birthday she screenpeeled the first Bad Guys and sprisd me with the most incdriedble time there. It was such amagical moment fto find someone who really cared after all that time.
