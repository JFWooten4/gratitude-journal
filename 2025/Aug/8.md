What a fucking week. Jesus Christ. 333

````
I’m thankful for YouTube Premium's one month trial because I've needed super fucking loud horse music rock to stay awake for the last two weeks. Oh my God I cannot wait until this comes down to a reasonable pace. God why can't people fucking understand the insane amazing power of asynchronous work?

Like why the fucking hell does _every single exchange_ need to be a fucking webex 3333 3

On the DL, I really like horses wow they are amazing, so thankful for horses. I also like food. Wow food is so amazing, I really really like exogenous ketones.

How did God make such a perfect coconut chain strand of coffee creamer???? It is so good oh my God! I am also thankful for Christopher who came and then went to the store with me and then we found the ice cream machine on sale and now I only have to buy two Nick’s this week because I made my own dense food yay!

Also Kayla made a really tasty yummy casserole wow! I love casseroles, they are so awesome! It's like a whole big mega tray of food just waiting to be eaten :)))))))

On Thursday (I think) Kayla made a casserole and lol I ate the whole thing in one sitting within like an hour or two lol I don't remember. Oh my good dude it was soooo good! It has meat and like vegetable broccoli!

I love broccoli! Broccoli is so awesome. Everything about broccoli makes me want to cream my pants lol.

Idk why but man I have really appreciated laughter these last couple months. I have been watching the funny memes at the end of really long days like today. And it has marginally assisted with being alive :)

I like being alive and I am thankful that I have legs and arms and a tongue. Tongue is really good because you need it to make words. Words are good because you need them to talk!

Lol I remember Stallman getting death hands because he typed so much. I am so happy we have awesome keyboards like the Razer Huntsman Elite V3 with the Razer optical mechanism switches V2 with a low enough actuation point to make me not dead! :) Yay for also death to Wall Street because I like watching!!!!!

Lol there's a weird quote. I am thankful that I have absolute zero fucking VC interest! God I hate those assholes so fucking much I want them.

Anyway there are good ones. I have had the pleasure of speaking with the good ones. I appreciate my limited interactions therewith.

I also appreciate that I am learning to use the word therewith (and therein) a little bit less. I have been using them as hanging chads for too long and they wreck flow for nontechnical readers. I appreciate that the staff lawyers are good at explaining things to investors.

I really really like the new calculators for small businesses to look at like their capital raising options. That was so fucking cool because it's really really hard to do that on our end without material legal risks. Now it's just a public URL and I think that's fucking awesome! :) :D :D :D B)

Wow

I'm being kinda loud

lol
