I've come to accept a lot of things, and I see a clear path forward. No mtter what we do next, I need to finishe the SEC response and SDEX page . IF thye want to do anyhting later than this wil be the crucial setup.

I envision everythign clearing itself out by end-of-year. I tink my Q4 distraction project will be the relaitnoship work. I finished the first post's skeleton and happy output.

I thought about thks alternative working closure for the year, becuase it's been so so so reepatative in my life. It started an eternity ago with mining hardware, and it's repeated like clockwork up to the community DEX interationcs. I'm thankful for a seemingly instatiable curitosity to keep pushingthe boundaries.

On one had I appreciate having the knowlege ot vie and see what other paths could've looked like before all this. What a life I've been gifted with so thnakfully. THer's always been this one constant ever since my connection with markets way way back.

o....I'm oging to figure thes enext hings out, and I know it'll give me the clarity I need to execute the kill shot. Whether they trigger it or not, everything needs to be in place. I really appreciate the bandwidth to figure this out from my own flouwring lens rather than a strict overseen mandate.

I;'m thankful for a erspective comparing myself today to only the past. I can see quite a distance I've gown, and it really helps to frame it through my own viewpoin. The monting externalities are just gone for the first time in years, and I love the freedom of blazing his train l with the poeple I know will best steward investor protections.

pI appreciate hat I can find clarity as to best uses of my time and personal badndwidth. I had the opporuntiy to go really hard ast week inthe communit fund call and it left me on regen for at elast 18 hours. I've thankfull y come to releizse after the complete silence from the world that I don't have to speak to succeed, and I appreciate that.

I want tokeep things in balck and white because it lets me stay at the helm of my own narrative. IT's a balance of skill ebcause of the adding perspectives of other members in the ocmmuntiy calls. But I really do want more focused written expression.

I had the pleasure of finishing the WhatCan forward last week.  I shot it in Monda jsut as there was a ton of ocmmuntiy exciptment about the submission window. Really happy to see such ingeniousness flourishing.

Working to dearly to figure out proper incentives and rewards for everyone. I know we can geet this done togeter with very efficient allocaitons. I htink at how much profit the establishedplayers rake in par tema meber, and I know we can make those numbers work a whole lot more ficiently, even if we do have to use fiat.

I really appreciate that hte crypto rails exist. WE need the mso so dearly. I hope our benevault access vision saves us all from tight grip the rothschilds will never release.

Kayla wasreally hepful in setting up the dentist.  i appereciate htat she is willing and able to help with som ousoehold secretarial work. in another life it woud've made sense to deeply intertwine centralized channels

I'm using it notw as an inspiration for establishing team well-being, espeically as we're larlgely apart. There's something to the discord dopamine that Iknow we can bring together while staing forward. it's already workign really really well, and I kjust wontder how we might intertwine it with a collective organization offeing the contracting services.

that's one of the beuties I really appreciate about cpaitlism/ the magic of contracts. and the depednaibility of private property.

got to spend some time prepping materials fro the exit panel, it helped clear up my thking on next steps with the commission. I really appreciated the lack of politcking they ebodied by completely ignoring / deffering the exchange poitns brought up

i didn't realize how good they are at following the letter of the law. i will make my last public appearance this week to get hte ocmmuntiy up to speed., then, I will appreciate some silent space to bring the enxt central p[olicy agenda forward i n line with thier reccomednantions

also got to mke the nqg starting post on tusdahy. it was a pretty dense piece of politicking. i aprpeacite the years of experince I've had to practice peenetrating the burocracie

so much thorugh into that second half. im not sure how much of it was filling the time allotted v deep thinking. but i do remember just how menaingful some of those wrirting decisions were in clarifying my persepctive on retroactive consideration

I feel like I'm right here at the starting line, but my tank is emprty. if i could jsut get hte gas to start this economic machine, I know I'd be the fastest racer by a landslide. it's a new perspective i'm exploring in the relations side where masculinity crafts visionary scope with deference to femenine action

I know i've seen this so clearly though the years of freelancer help. but it was always much more controlling, directive, and dominnent. this is my first chance to really give things a whire at scale based on togethernedss.
