I'm doing a pretty good job getting more items expressed through working and personal agenda items. It's been about since starting the work week, and I honestly made more personal progress than towards the Response.

I just need to get the narrative right in my head before I start committing things to the screen. Ideas to paper require clarity, or else the output just looks like mumbo-jumbo. I suppose it's why these ramble on sometimes, since it's more an output.

I'm having a good time working things out orally.

I guess I'm getting more used to the idea of K, and it's meant tackl

Things aren't

I'm just glad that the dynamic lets me focus primarily on work. But I am finding the line between too much commitment and passion, which has been going on for some time.

I got the relationship site a little more personalized today with the Flawless branding from community art.

I'm really liking the community art, and that's one of the coolest things I'm glad to take away from this whole review process. It really brought me down to my core and showed me a lot on the personal side I didn't know was latent and hiding. So perhaps it'll be fun figuring out the nuance there until EoY before transitioning that into a public project in about 8 months.

Anyway, all that should mean less needs here, especially because I barely use it as a manifesting or positivity tool anyway. I want to get back into doing that, and hell I think the public forum here would be pretty great for it.

It works so well, but I still need to finish brought-forth efforts from mid-last year. It's crazy how much those scopes expanded, and I am glad it's all really come full-circle. We only have so much time until Wall St catches on, which is why I largely decided against the central intel gathering at Mare Fair next month.

I really want to reward myself with a full cartel of outing on that route with K alongside next year. Hopefully we can get an extra 5k in discretionary, while we are skating by now thankfully. She's working hard and actually learned a lot about how hard her job is in discussion on Friday night late.

Also got to go on a fun date to the Ohio River park yesterday. I skated while we laughed at how hot the benches got. I'm glad we can still do our own things together.

Afterher we went to this funny sushi place that was a trip and a half, as expected from craziness! I brought her to get unicorn ice cream first and she loved it with the sprinkles because she won a footrace. Then we both got a bunch of sushi rolls, which was really refreshing because I've had so little filling food this week (ew rice, but also... yum).

On the way out we got this awesome sake bomb experience at the table, and K chugged and caught it all in a wide open mouth! Also there was like a cool free appetizer buffet thing with so many tasty rolls (minimal b/c fried) and yummy sesame balls (rice flour, right?). That was a good time.

Then we saw *A Midsummer Night's Dream* in the nearby turf park! It was a beautiful night and I'm thankful for the performance. It reminded me of a 25 pound contribution to the Raven art fund after figuring out the complexity of PayPal international fees.

I appreciate the opportunity I have to help shape the arts without the subservient romantic connections I thought about before. It's been so many hours GPTing with myself to get that viewpoint. And I appreciate just how much it helps with the TAD stack alignment around DUNA participation.
