Okay, so we are back from the Chicago music festival! I know I was a little skeptical about this public thing at first, but I'm finding it useful in connecting disparate thoughts between different work-products. I was just able to reference this repo in a pending public decision for my personal repo, and that was pretty cool.

I've been getting a lot more in touch with my feelings lately, especially in re the whole dark exploration thing. That has been directly an exceptional influence into how my head works. I'm really really thankful for all that Autumn's done just being their awesome self to help guide me into this journey (and I think now we're coming out the other end of the tunnel).

A core part of this emerged in the drive there with K when we discussed this whole changed sleep schedule I did to form around her second shift and the DUNA meetings. It has really taken a lot out of me, and we were both fortunate enough to recognize that these last few months. We resolved to go back to serenity in an effort to reduce stress (best way I can think to put it positively as self-success) and decrease necessary food intake since I won't push myself so far.

The night just takes a lot of energy because you are fundamentally shaping dark matter, and it edges you right up against the barrier of death itself. It's a surreal and ancestral experience where I feel my thoughts shaping reality quite directly. I was so exceptionally thankful tail of last week and closing into now that these efforts in one part or another brought our scope of review up to prudence.

I've also thankfully come to understand much through the natural parks and botanical gardens I explored both downtown (far south) and up north. All were near museums or botanicals (in the later case of the zoo visit), which offered invaluable space to observe reality. I really love being able to quickly put on headphones and some pony tunes so that I can isolate productively in a crowded public space.

More schematically, I loved staying on the train line and zipping into the city each day. Really cool system which I got to partially explore (I think it's crazy how I used to just raw dog entire maps like it was nothing!). The events and things like U. Chicago campuses were just too big a draw to walk away from the tracks, and it was fun lol!

I appreciated the stellar education I continued through audiobooks on the walks. It can take quite some mental effort to digest these concepts as I have for so so many years. I appreciate the ability each of us has to pursue information and cement ideas therefrom into concrete thoughts. I'm just always continuously surprised by the mind's incredible function.

Another thing I've found is that I've let down my mask for perhaps the first time with Kayla these last few months. Without the mental bandwidth to keep up the "social-friendly" act, I've just gone to my bare self, which I even felt a little in the second staff meeting. I think about how well I managed assets, but I was completely abhorred by the schema in which I was bound.

I think I've finally come to the same conclusion with politicking relationships. I thought we'd have way more mainstream attention over all these years, but the crickets and disinterest from Congress has really given me the space to let myself down a little on the social labor. Don't get me wrong, I still want quite surely to have those high-profile developments so that we all move forward together, but it's kind of nice knowing it will be on my terms going forward which broadly means written input.

To not have to apply my politicking skills (or whatever you call social persuasions) anymore... it's really cool. I sorta feel the same way about the SDF, although they haven't given me explicit affirmation yet like the staff. It means a lot to just have a good rapport with someone on the basis of shared factual understanding, not backdoor favors or emotions.

As for some last parts on the Chicago trip, Kayla had an absolute blast and was really relaxed by the logistical planning I minimally contributed early on. She was so excited when we got Giordano's famous deep dish pizza plus a special Jollibee takeout! I enjoyed speaking with the staff there intermittently, which was sort of new for me.

I think much of it stems from my comfort interacting with others playing a "role" in career-settings. It's relatively easy for me to predict responses, which means little social capital expended internally. I still appreciate the smiles even though they take so much space to process.

I had another conversation with a relatively quiet guy waiting for K to exit the park one day. We were sitting there when a guy walked into the curb and ate pavement right in front of six cops. They got an EMS when he tried to get up, run, and stumble. That wound up in another fall despite the best efforts of a third person next to me.

Surprisingly, he walked away despite the blood. Something I've really liked hearing in the hardcore Prince songs that kept me going when food reserves ran low.

Turns out some girl just randomly asked him for directions, before they chatted it up (and he was now waiting for her to leave). She came to his place beforehand and broadly it was a weird surprise neither of us would normally approach. I think it's a kinda cool representation of how the world just makes things fall into place when times are right.

I also enjoyed the downtown art museum which had a sick rendering of the Chicago Stock Exchange floor. A lot of cool old art there and at the U. Chicago museum. Also got to enjoy flipping around and off the Griffin museum, which was by a beautiful expansive lake.

Appreciated experiencing the historic column work there and at the stadium. I saw it on one of my many riverside walks into the night. Pretty and comfy this time of the year, waving towards the edge.
