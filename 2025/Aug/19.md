Okay, trying to get back to doing these daily. I think it really helps me a lot more than I can tell. Getting into the roll of my normal sleeping regime, and it's going well.

I'm thankful for the relatively rested mornings. Looking forward (sorta lol) to figuring out exercise without the centralized locale. I am really yearning the connection with nature I felt back in the XC days. Time deployment, but I just know that I need a creative outlet somewhere on that spectrum.

Tomorrow will be my last day before going into the finishing sprint. I'm thankful for the ties we've built together these last couple years. I found it funny in the old physical legacy journal this time two years ago was precisely when personal challenges arose.

Who knows where we'll be by November. But I know I've teed the bases up perfect from my shot. From Earth to Moon and around the Lego Sun, I'm excited!

My knees are doing better after the working craziness swinging. I appreciate that I can well position myself on the pad as a tripod, as K made me do last night twice! Lol she has been doing a lot better lately as I pull to center on myself and masculinity.

I'm really immeasurably thankful for the opportunity to explore those themes. I really don't know what will stem from it as of yet, but I am already loving the results. The confidence to pull the Syndicate re-site on the basis of buttfuck's meme was seriously something I've been working towards since seeing it weeks and weeks ago.

A lot of things are changing, but also staying the same. I appreciate this great base I've built up and now my incredible opportunity to mold the clay into its final form. Long been awaiting the kiln burning.

Good day.

Really really happy to see such a fucking awesome feminine reply from Raven.

I want to be very careful with my dt
