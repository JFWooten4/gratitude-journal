things are goong well. busy and well. making a lot of progress  , albeit the work is sorta like mind-numbing

i think of kayla nad the fun i get to have at the end ofth e day. she was a bright msile hen making apple lices ealier. and so much yummy leftover

she made some sugar 2octopber pumpkin cookies today. i can't believe it's almost haloween. i am thinking i have the strength now in her cooking to go full off sugr even if nothing changes ith sponsors

thats an exciting feelign for me because it gives me back permission to work at my pace. it was a crayz intense year that taught me the meaning of burnount. i just hope we get some strong results from the stellar work
