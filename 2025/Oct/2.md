Things are going well. Busy and well. Making a lot of progress, albeit the work is sorta like mind-numbing.

I think of Kayla and the fun I get to have at the end of the day. She was a bright smile when making apple slices earlier. And so much yummy leftover.

She made some sugar-free October pumpkin cookies today. I can't believe it's almost Halloween. I am thinking I have the strength now in her cooking to go full off sugar even if nothing changes with sponsors.

That's an exciting feeling for me because it gives me back permission to work at my pace. It was a crazy intense year that taught me the meaning of burnout. I just hope we get some strong results from the Stellar work.
