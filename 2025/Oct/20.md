I am doing better at friendship. Yay! There were a lot of developments last night when I went really hard with music again.

The politicking work is just a lot of stress, because I want to get things perfect. There are always a million factors at play and it feels good to get them all lined up proper. Heck these last months I really did feel like I should take on the CEO-style role of a Syndicate owned by the DUNA.

Power is really enticing. It lets me achieve my goals and have fun all at the same time. I have to let it go, and that is hard.

I always had trouble... idk how to frame it differently, maybe I could always improve. It was just hard for me to give up control over things I cared about because I do think I know the best and right way. Because I always put in so much work to get things right.

But that's... gah I don't see things explicitly wrong with it. I like that I have a masculine approach to my work and move ahead as I think best. I like the progress going along with my plans.

But I've realized that the effort here is extreme, and thus it is a centralized unnatural activity. Others know so much more collectively and deserve the stage to work. And I can support them by allocating capital to what I support.

I am in the midst of these existential choices to pick a team for what is practically forever. I think of all that's at stake, and I appreciate the opportunity to work on it. It's why I put so much care into the politics.

I want to get all that right, and I routinely think about what it would be like in office. But it's taking everything from me that I value deeply. I can do it very well, but it's a face and act like the masking I know so well.

I've said this is the last to a lot of things this year. I think I'm finally at my wits end on politicking, crafting a public narrative that services my policies. I just want to move on and exclusively focus on friends and our collaborations.

I know we can all get the freedom to be enough. It just seems we'll have to do it in this system they've wrapped around us. I just want to give everyone incredible investment returns, while balancing out the long-term implications of those incentives.

Others are starting to talk about planning in decades and centuries, but they do so from a place of centralized control and superior knowledge. I just want to ignore their rhetoric and advance the freedom evident in founding ideologies that also wanted to preserve power in George. As much as I... guh I just hope for political expediency based on technical competence and design considerations.
