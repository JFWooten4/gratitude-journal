man im titred but wa2ted to tkae am inute for myslf in this since I probably won't tommorow. excited for a new tamers ep , whch is osmething it feels nice to b eble to say to myself. the public part ais anticical jto just being accepting of my own itnerests

i donlt know how the CEO type people deal wiht all thisbecause it is s omuch. like I am familair with getting used to pain and whetheringthrough the though bits. that's not my quandary

it's just the constantn knwoing that everythign's on your shoulders. it's an immense responsability that pusehds me to give so much into everything. i do feel like i carry that even without hte explecit titles

the scf work is cemendting into ollective support around all the changes ive proposed. i am excited to see how it expands as we start workign otgether more to fix tihings. the hard part is i need to make all these personal choices about my own stances on things, which is tough becasue th existing wok has tried so hard

i do feel like th eguy going in an tearing down a home ot build a skyscraper, and ive always felt the need to rportect the existing intffrastructure. but i just cnat stand fo yatta yatta. im going to tyry to kerp hi laight

lately dicussion of piolitics has been a real bore on me. its just gotten less and less fun t o censor myself out of respect for a dilapidated status quo. even thogh the power is completely lopsided, my friends are supporting me to speak the trtuht and be myself.

thans for that - yo uguys let me mbe th ehunter. i am also making new frineds as i grow back ito the fandom. i think I drifted away becasue I forgot about some of the art . but things have ebeen heating up again and there is so much amazing actvie publiations i want to support.

chives supports the postition kayla takes on that, and i apprecaited their perspective on things. it feels like us against the world soemtimes, and i will admit that ti  eels good to have someone else to share the work with. i feel a little guilyty because i have tall this central work to do aroudn the investor emailigns autpmation, but hearing them cheer on suscesfful wins helps a lot. i want to go down that road again and again, and i need ot setup the tup wiot som love

ive found a lot of love in the fandom content, and i know that love exitststs too in the other onine spaces. it's something special i feel cpaitalism robbed from out local physicl worlds. and i appreciate the oppourntinty to spread it onlien to the greatext extent possible

i remmeber walkign through th etowers and vineyards of some of those europena  castles. it was so interesting to see the walls and understand the dyanmics. now i getto tdo that as a firsthand forerunner into a new financial system, and it's really exciteing

also, i've spent some time bettering my self and, looking back, i cna undertand hte position of brunson. POeple want to support artists through thier live event tickets, and it's reasonable to ahve the same inclination towards business teachers. i tis a choice to practicelife like that, and who am i to judge others for how they spend their funds

sometimes th eexternalities yatta yatta, but i trust people to do what's best for them. i was in that spot a logn time ago, and i jsut appreacite ho wwe can sitll coordinate and try to do good in the world. i wna tto take everyone i cna down the path i see as idal for capita;l

hings are cleaning up, and i took time for mtyslef for the first time in porbably eight month these last few days. just a couple tours total including tommorow with ony content that makes me smile. it's really appreciated becaue i wnat to hold theline ith only healthy contents in ym body
