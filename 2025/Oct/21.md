I'm starting to realize that there are groups of people I want to be friends with. And then there are individuals or organized types of mindsets which I do not like, to put it nicely. I can actually just ignore the latter, and my communication becomes a whole lot easier.

When I only talk to friends, I can get used to the tone of friendliness. It lets me find ease and comfort in being myself to the betriment of friends. Not sure if that's a word, but basically by voicing earnestly I get to boost up my buds.

I'm so happy that this is coming together while Prince does his move. I thought it was so cool how Bri was in a similar spot when we started working together. I have a unique ability to take and move people towards a higher state when I give selflessly.

In effecting this sentiment, I will stop reading all the historic depository content from the monopoly, alongside their new rule (comment) proposals. I was so ingrained in pointing out the flaws within the CCP structure that I forgot who I am and what I care about. I see in the Foundation response the glimmers of friendship I've longed for so long in professional bureaucratic relations, and I'm going to run with it as far as I can while giving them the space to wade through the opposition as necessary.
