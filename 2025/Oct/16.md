I miss the market. A time ago, it was everything to me in practically every way. And with the removal of Kayla's assets from my playbook by integral choice, I am deeply isolated with only the minimum of minimal long-term lumen holdings left in the Soroban domains.

Even now.

Uh.

We went to Chicago, which was really fun. Kayla went to another concertsss. Lol she had so much fun and did an amazing job planning things out.

I thought a lot about Insull when she asked about living there, along the lines and traction. I sorta like the vertical house thing with all the stairs, and I think it'd be really cool to have four floors with a bedroom seeing the stars and an office just under for staying the world.

I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A MILLION THINGS TO SAY TO THE WORLD, AND EVERY SINGLE ONE REQUIRES VAST AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL. CAPITAL I WANT TO DEPLOY IN A VERY UNIQUE WAY I'VE NEVER SEEN DONE BEFORE. AND I YEARN TO FULFILL MY LIVELIHOOD WITH THAT STIMULATION.

I'VE COME TO RECOGNIZE THAT I THRIVE IN THE GROWTH PHASE WHEN THINGS ARE REALLY BECOMING A NEW PARADIGM. I DO NOT WANT TO CONTINUE INVESTING IN THE LATE STAGES OF EFFORTS. IT'S FINE TO LET POSITIONS RIDE, BUT I AM REALLY INTERESTED IN CATCHING THE EARLIER FLIERS, EVEN IF IT MEANS MISSING OUT ON THE LONG-TERM COMPOUNDING.

(ALTHOUGH THAT ONLY HAPPENS IF YOU SELL, WHICH I ONLY HAD TO DO BECAUSE OF BECOMING A MAJOR. BUT SEE IT HAS RELEVANCE TO THE RELATIONSHIP ASSETS I WANT TO DISCUSS. LAST COUPLE WEEKS I FINALLY STARTED SPREADING SOME CAPITAL OUT AROUND THE BRONY FANDOM, AND EVEN GOT MYSELF NIGHTTIME GLASSES UWU!)

Wow I don't know where caps lock came from. It definitely felt like I was living like that these last months, in the summer esp. I can't believe how much time has gone by since then, and there's still so much to do.

I am happy things are so vibrant, but I'm questioning whether this living situation can accommodate the immense amount of work I need to complete. I thought my foundation was solid bedrock, but now I'm realizing it could be the same mud everyone else uses. I just want something closer to the market.

I love the market so much. I don't understand how I lost it, but I respect my choices to favor integrity over xxxxx (idk, what do you call it: adrenaline, joy, happiness?). There's something to investing that's just so amazing, and I wish I had someone who could share that feeling with me.

Man where to even find something like that... I have no clue. But I feel like I need it to remain authentic to myself. That or mounds of capital to deploy.

I think things will clear up by March next year. It looks like I'll have the time I'll need, even if it doesn't come with emotional stability or wholeness. Because I've done so much and people need to care.

I feel better now. It was nice to write that out. I might stop lamenting on the things Kayla and I do together, because meh.

I've introduced her to how I really am and what I really care about. Idk we'll see if she can prove herself and make things work. I see so much of will bent towards my objectives, and I just wonder how.

I need to get ready because things will happen quickly. DFV could buy all the warrants any fucking day now. I just hope the apes recognize how big this is after it's all over and help us grow alongside their generous efforts.

What we have today is so disconnected. It rips people away from the most amazing invention ever created. Makes them think that markets are actually the forms of middlemen they see each day.

But we need certificate authorities to enforce standards. We can prosper when investors are protected with a basic level of diligence. And I know we can do it together on a completely new level to anything regulators or titans have ever seen before.

It's been so much progress lately in oral conversation that I can't close my eyes or turn off my brain. I even cancelled my gym membership some weeks back to take out ancillary noisiness and focus on absorbing the sentiment growth all around. I want to give my complete and total ability to the cause once we are funded, because I care about asset management more than anything in the world and will show everyone just how amazing I can be with a portfolio made of friendship.
