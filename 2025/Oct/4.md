Yay things are going better now that I had a day off. I got to clean my office and scan a lot of the old stickies. I'm thankful for physical written materials that stay maintained over time.

I'm also really happy to finally get things digitized because it is so much easier to organize. And I appreciate the cloud options to keep things in place for like ever lol. Crazy that historic docs were lost to time and physical decay.

Yay good old authors. Yay from Meridian recordings with friends. Cool to be aligned even from far apart.
