just need a minut. relaize how awesome the original coe contirbution in 870 was for the stellar-docs, backward mind says hoped to spend more time analzing in the first place. Bri has deifnaely been tag-teaming things with me , whcih is trlaly great and helpful -  i like how she can make her own filzlizing edits.

iwant to address some lingering whiteboarded points: from like a months ago i was happy t lay out mre network vision points. i forget if it was in docs or somse communtiy chats . i;ve appreciated the feww in the eocsystem who understadn the maeanignful marketp erctive 

it was relly refreshing to be aon a call last week wednesday nigt, linked... (kol there i go gin trying to document absolutely everything perfeftly). I remember when Donna was like lol we don't need the exact insurance doc in the second meeting. that was sorta refreshing ebcuase i think she got how i anaal i was about eveyrthing being exactly in place

kayla talked to me about it eysterday, how she had struggledwi hteperfcectionism at wok. i know thigns dont need to be perfect, nd i accept that i need to give thing to others and accept their results without hadnign it over to my own standrds. but there's a different ceb etween all that micromanagement and 


i just want to bmake things of high quality. i like how lego is like "perfect is the satanrd". they always made the best star wards things to indluence my childhood

the thing that frelaly stands out is how yu can build something that will last decadees. the bricks dont' mold or warmp. and i've put them under some really hot situations

i strive for that in my own work, ebcause i know i wont be around here forever. and so i want to leave people with something taht they cna comprehent. korean buput it nicely when remarkeing (approximatel) that hey r dum (rip) but can understadn thnings if you explain it adeuatly to them


anyway i think it was adam asked me if i wanted to take the conversation one way or more towards a vision of the network or the next decade. that wsa pretty sick becuase nobody (yes i ma not going back to generlized nopony) has ereally asked what i think about direction like ever. the years of stellar dev mailing list (with the important exceptoin of CAP42 /sep39 sasset split talks with ocnsitructive feedback_)  was pretty quiet from an intellectual side.

we mightn ot be hte perfect tema, bt u we're trying. and thats also why i appreciatedkayal. shes been maiing a lot of food and wokring all hours likem e lately, reeally appreciated behadvior.

i think back then i helped with some chores, and i even did dishes with my wrist last nigh. po... i olook forward to having the gov n place so that that sorta collabtiorion is easier online as well. 


it feels really good to be cleairng out myh personal thoughts. there's just so much going on in my haead, i need to bring some of things things down ou of the air.  i remember when things got really though after repsonse 5, i played the last vadar immortal game on that quest from US bank. what a trip that was,

actually first time i had cider, which i know would make the whinney pones happy. i didnt like the feelign and am goingback off, as it was my onwly drink literlly ever (full at lest) and even then no tastes since childhood. but it was a little fun dizzily swingin the saber

anyway, i areally appreacited the sotyr across the series. and i loved how it all wrapped up. i saw a lot of my own transformatin in the game as i qested hrough over the last year

kayla was so awesome getting those credits fo me valients day. she learned what i wanted and just amade it the most fn thing ever. i was thinkign about doing a "values thereapy " together with her and gpt, but it never erallh happeneed in the cenral frame i had in mind

i had it slated here for sunday, but the motional intensoity crossing with the start of response 8 work just had me at an insane inesit output levle. i was so apranoid about the physcial security after that car , and then like fkn the officers were waydiffernet than the station. im just glad i was good at trading wit hat and left a public trail

anwyas main thing was that ive realized how muhc she cares about me. it was really close to tough departure again like after response 4. but we jus couldnt bear seperatoin

it oculd be a challenge on compatabilit gorunds, but i just hope these next years prove theoposite. i want so dearly to go back ot the 50s-era prosperity where both partenrs aren't foreced to labr oendlessly to the behest of what looks lmore andm ore like  a ruling class.

guh

i just have been thinking a lto fabout insuall and contemplating the governannce and ownership modelthey used. requireing private natural monopoly ivves you the efficney and control, and it was ain all likelihood needed with the communication tools back thne. e only eh could see the public discussio nhwe have now, how anyone from anywehre can hel p to make it all a better place

i appreacite my mom and dad for always supporting me, especially through this stressful time when i jsut needed raw help. i try to do thate same for k ebecause she usually normally mostly can reciprocte , and the nlike my parents keep wanting to see me like her so its fun andnice to be wanted and have a plcace to go. i also appreacite my strong workth ethic and focus

laslty, k and i played a lot of cards together lately, which i found helped take the edge off when i needed to think but keep mym ind actively distracted. double soliate r was fun, and then we got the dune emptior um game form the library but ocunlt figure out how to play it lol. so rewe rpleaced with tiwth a unicorn card game where we had a blad allocating our stbales full of beatifu lcreates
