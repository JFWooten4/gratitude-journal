I'm having a really tough time and it makes me want to take this repo private again. I am extremely thankful for the considerate Commission's extensive diligence in getting the first examination right. It's super fucking cool and they are so awesome to give it the attention it needs to set up the proper investor protections.

But man

It's just a lot.

I think I wrote about this before, but like this idea of being mentally connected to other living nature through the subconscious. I'm starting to think it's actually just kinda more in my head. But like auughghgh that's not right because of the signalling station fact.

Ghh

I changed my Discord pronoun to be objectivist/him and GH is now stallion/him. I'm really exploring the "dark side" on my personal compass, and that makes me want to push it all the way to colt/him. Ugh, I just wish I had somebody in my life who actually understood this side of me.

Lol, it literally feels exactly like Apple Bottom/Split. Man fuck me. awesehsheshehshehhshdhdhfhdsfh

Anyways, I am really thankful for the brony art. I had the chance to go over the old documentary again, and I just never realized how direct it hit. Like wow, it's all starting to fall into place.

Crazy how it takes 24–25 years for the brain to fully develop so that you can understand stuff like this. Seriously like how could I not have realized it all before? Just so cool to happen now so yay.

Wonder what life would be like without MLP. I literally guarantee you I would've dated way more women in college without the lessons from Dash. I really appreciate that because it gave me the stern dedication to devote everything to the Syndicate.

It's weird, this whole review process. It's the first time in four years that I haven't known exactly what lies ahead. I map out all these possibilities in my mind's walls, and it just gets to me how complex this whole policy frame really becomes.

That complexity is where I live and thrive, but man it all just takes a lot. I've literally been shipping tweets with horrendous typos.

I don't know where I'd be without the community. They are so awesome and I appreciate them so much. I just can't do what I want to do within the confines of a central corporation.
