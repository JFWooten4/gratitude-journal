another day with even more stories. and g&g gave me hte rings. wow that was pretty aweesome of them to share

main storise were from gradnpa. some tales from working his way up in the air force. ad times hwen running things in a position of subordiante power.

rise up wsas pretty sick because he was able to become a commanding officer with only 700 flight-hours of expiernece, when the normal requirement is 10000. he was bale to get past a lot of beurocatic crap by his confidence and creativity. reminded me of the time he got into the special flight training school.

he was in conneticuit and a luitent striving for a spot that was reseved for colnol-generals and up. but that didn't stop gradnpa. he knew he could do it, and so did everyone else who flied with him and saw how incedible and safe he was.

on the day before the start of class,m grandpa used his commander's phone to call the school and get from the secretary to the general boss. he pitching him that there had to be an open spot from somone who dropped out, died, or ldeft the service.

And with some sweet talkign about how everyone would be better off with a full class, he had himself the one dropped slot! Everyone won and he made the general look great because he was an excellent student. gradnpa went hom to tell gradnma the news, and she couldnt belive it!

he had to be there when classes tarted at 7-8a m tommorow in texas, so he drove them thoughout the night under georgous stars. grandma had their first child and the corvette had its roof down as they went to the enxt military housing. he was overall super thankfull for all her support throughout his years.

one story was about how they were attending a huge dinner with the whole base. the commander govt everyone set up and then announced that the preacher wasnt there and the grace would be said by..... gradnma! gradnpa was so relieved that it wasnt him!

She did such an awesome job, every soldier there wanted her to be the normal speaker after just three minute prayer. i coudln believe how quickly she was up and out of town with him, and lol he though there were people coming after him on the way to class because he was th youngest gy there. everyone couldnt believe it during studies until they saw him out in a plane.

some other crazy ones like the cross-country trip with a drunkard first officer in his firt time in a b47. pretty sick plane, and he was in the back on the way from NY to LA. bit he reallyhad to help with the land by the time htey got there because the guy was drinking booze from a thermos the whol trip

htey had to leave hte next morning, and im thankful grandpa shared the whole stry with me. theo thers stayed out all ngihtand slept n drunk. while grandpa got everything configured, they still werent reacdy by departure time. so he took command and told them this was now his plane and he was runnign the show back home or else.

and he did and asedeomse fucking job, even landing midway though to refuel and taking everything back home safely. got a ton of awesome accolatdes form that because everyone figured out (from someone lese) that grandpa did amazing. and he was up and going from there.

reminds me otf another story he cried while telling me, ike gradnma yesterday with her mom's laife.  iappreciate them both being so waweosme adn candid. ill never forget their joy when giving me the gins and supporting me from their bed.

gradnpa was base commander later adn had an awesome time keeping fmoral and performance up. one christmas there was a power shortage, so he had to stop any unnecesary light usage, jsut like the netire town. not even the church could keep its cross up bright, and certainly more than two lightbulbs on in a house was a sking for a warning. 

gbut gradnpa knew they had to make things right, so he hedld a contest where winning teams got $100+. everyone painted a big hirstmas mural , adn they came out spectactularlly with shining leaves and inspired lights. gradnpa had them hung up out front of the base where ll the cars passed by and the hwole town lvoed them.

then, on christmas ever, he had someone go bget a bucnh of ten spotlights and wire them up to illuminate the painintgs. everyone thgouht he would get fired, but gradnpa said ti wouldve been worth it because poeple ghwere getting sad. it got so much attention that the national media picked it up and made the base in platsburg famous.!

lo leveryone liked it, and when the general inevtiably called him, he said he was glad grandpa was so "dumb!" grapnda says obivously he coudlnt compliment him, but lol he was so supportive aof what happened and he real human cam e oput to commend him for good work in the face of perosnla thereat/.

some other stories. got arrests fodwn by making inmates ice-pick at the tstreets.

also the guy who was na exceptional mechanismc. compeltely self-taught and coulmd make anythign work, hwom was then sent to bunch of schooling by the army

but drinking challenges drove him to fights too far, even after grandpa started up a new housing program. it was to get more people on baseso they werent communtign through two feet of snow

everyone liked it and was happy, but thigs guys family left their house a completel mess because they were never taught to toss spilled milk for simply ask for furnitire freely. thigns got bad and he had to send him home, but we wernt out drinkign on the Chivcago layover and got himself hikilled in a barfight

granpda spoke with his mom before teh travels and she lpleasded him to neot send, but there was ntohgni helse he could do. somethign he clearly cared a lot about
