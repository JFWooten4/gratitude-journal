Another day with even more stories. And G&G gave me the rings. Wow, that was pretty awesome of them to share.

Main stories were from Grandpa. Some tales from working his way up in the Air Force, and times when running things in a position of subordinate power.

Rise up was pretty sick because he was able to become a commanding officer with only 700 flight hours of experience, when the normal requirement is 10,000. He was able to get past a lot of bureaucratic crap by his confidence and creativity. Reminded me of the time he got into the special flight training school.

He was in Connecticut and a lieutenant striving for a spot that was reserved for colonel-generals and up. But that didn't stop Grandpa. He knew he could do it, and so did everyone else who flew with him and saw how incredible and safe he was.

On the day before the start of class, Grandpa used his commander's phone to call the school and get from the secretary to the general boss. He pitched him that there had to be an open spot from someone who dropped out, died, or left the service.

And with some sweet talking about how everyone would be better off with a full class, he had himself the one dropped slot! Everyone won and he made the general look great because he was an excellent student. Grandpa went home to tell Grandma the news, and she couldn’t believe it!

He had to be there when classes started at 7–8 a.m. tomorrow in Texas, so he drove them throughout the night under gorgeous stars. Grandma had their first child and the Corvette had its roof down as they went to the next military housing. He was overall super thankful for all her support throughout his years.

One story was about how they were attending a huge dinner with the whole base. The commander got everyone set up and then announced that the preacher wasn’t there and the grace would be said by... Grandma! Grandpa was so relieved that it wasn’t him!

She did such an awesome job, every soldier there wanted her to be the normal speaker after just a three-minute prayer. I couldn’t believe how quickly she was up and out of town with him, and lol he thought there were people coming after him on the way to class because he was the youngest guy there. Everyone couldn’t believe it during studies until they saw him out in a plane.

Some other crazy ones like the cross-country trip with a drunkard first officer in his first time in a B47. Pretty sick plane, and he was in the back on the way from NY to LA. But he really had to help with the landing by the time they got there because the guy was drinking booze from a thermos the whole trip.

They had to leave the next morning, and I’m thankful Grandpa shared the whole story with me. The others stayed out all night and slept in drunk. While Grandpa got everything configured, they still weren’t ready by departure time. So he took command and told them this was now his plane and he was running the show back home or else.

And he did an awesome fucking job, even landing midway through to refuel and taking everything back home safely. Got a ton of awesome accolades from that because everyone figured out (from someone else) that Grandpa did amazing. And he was up and going from there.

Reminds me of another story he cried while telling me, like Grandma yesterday with her mom’s life. I appreciate them both being so awesome and candid. I’ll never forget their joy when giving me the rings and supporting me from their bed.

Grandpa was base commander later and had an awesome time keeping morale and performance up. One Christmas there was a power shortage, so he had to stop any unnecessary light usage, just like the entire town. Not even the church could keep its cross up bright, and certainly more than two lightbulbs on in a house was asking for a warning.

But Grandpa knew they had to make things right, so he held a contest where winning teams got $100+. Everyone painted a big Christmas mural, and they came out spectacularly with shining leaves and inspired lights. Grandpa had them hung up out front of the base where all the cars passed by and the whole town loved them.

Then, on Christmas Eve, he had someone go get a bunch of ten spotlights and wire them up to illuminate the paintings. Everyone thought he would get fired, but Grandpa said it would’ve been worth it because people were getting sad. It got so much attention that the national media picked it up and made the base in Plattsburgh famous!

Lol everyone liked it, and when the general inevitably called him, he said he was glad Grandpa was so “dumb!” Grandpa says obviously he couldn’t compliment him, but lol he was so supportive of what happened and the real human came out to commend him for good work in the face of personal threat.

Some other stories. Got arrests down by making inmates ice-pick at the streets.

Also the guy who was an exceptional mechanic. Completely self-taught and could make anything work, whom was then sent to a bunch of schooling by the army.

But drinking challenges drove him to fights too far, even after Grandpa started up a new housing program. It was to get more people on base so they weren’t commuting through two feet of snow.

Everyone liked it and was happy, but this guy’s family left their house a complete mess because they were never taught to toss spilled milk or simply ask for furniture freely. Things got bad and he had to send him home, but he went out drinking on the Chicago layover and got himself killed in a bar fight.

Grandpa spoke with his mom before the travels and she pleaded him to not send, but there was nothing else he could do. Something he clearly cared a lot about.

Awesome fireworks today. Just after we got the rings we drove up to the course and saw them from the north.

Exceptional finale, and Dad was there with Karina. We commented on how nobody else had the smiley face fireworks.

So glad to see everyone here today.

Christopher started up a rec basketball game with 10 kids randomly on the court. He was lighting it out there, having a blast, super fun to watch.

Good times in paradise.
