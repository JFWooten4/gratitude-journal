Pretty solid ass week. +1 strongarm emoji. I am getting better at food, and K made a fucking awesome chicken bake yesterday with the most incredible seasonings. It really helped me get in a lot of research.

Start of the week was awesome because Christopher visited on his big road trip. We hung around and explored the town his first day, playing a lot of tennis and pickleball. He really got into it and we had a great time in the park.

Next day, we drove up to the Wilbur Wright birthplace museum (lol there I go with the locale again). Well honestly they can send in the baddies at this point because the deed is done. Anyway, we had an awesome time exploring the farm/house antiquity.

Christopher and I thought it was so funny they had random orgies in the house thirty years after he died. It was extremely inspirational to see their story develop over years of persistence and just doing the work no matter what other people said. And lol they had a movie about the journey which had a really cool train + some plane animations.

So fun to get a pic with the big model together. A great time out especially after seeing Grandpa's models so recently, which resembled the legacy fighter jet they have on display in the middle. Christopher and I joked because the retirement home bus was just picking up tons of folks as we made our way in.

After that we drove through the farms to PIZZA KING where we had the KING of PIZZAs!!! Lol, Christopher was so excited to get the greatest pizza experience, and he devoured his _stacked_ meat pie at the bar! And Kayla was super fucking awesome to pack us protein shakes which we enjoyed.

It was fun bringing the mug into the bar, and it reminded me of the awesome salmon meal she made with Christopher when he first arrived in town. That was really sweet, and I appreciate how hard she tries on top of work. I might not be perfect at all this relationship stuff, but I'm so thankful I have something real to base all my work on before the glow up, because after that point it's practically impossible.

After lunch, Christopher and I went on a walk on one of those paved rail trails, which was fun because we got to see some of the local residents in the teeny tiny town. Christopher made great fun at the whole society because everyone kept easily telling he wasn't from nearby. That was especially true at our next stop in the basketball museum.

Christopher absolutely loved it the moment we pulled up to the giant Jordan. Had a lot of fun experiencing and interacting with the exhibits together. He looked like a total blast seeing how high he could jump on the wall.

Also got some great photos of the faux dunk angle. That was after we spent a ton of time shooting hoops in the practice zone together. Been a long long time since we had something special like that together.

Glad we have our unique interests. He was super infatuated by the documentary film, and we had some fun in the gift shop where he picked up a cool sticker.

After that, we went through the big park area to get to the immense skate park. Christopher couldn't believe there was something that big around! He did some pretty awesome moves on his board while I climbed around and watched.

After he completely tired himself out in the heat, we went to Walmart for one last attempt at disc golf frisbees, only to walk out with a Ninja Creami that was on a big sale. Had weird luck with Walmart sales lately, and I even got the Lego solar system (less other planets) today for half off to relieve some stress. I finished the first bag of that one, and btw that new numbered bagging system is crazy the fuck smart!

Anyway, after we learned that all the restaurants were closed until Wednesday, we drove home and took inventory on our food stock. Then Christopher got some awesome deliciousness chef ingredients at the store while I filled up my water yummy jugs. He made an awesome spread of spicy magic veggie chicken while I finally got a moment to rest.

After that, K came home and we talked deep into the morning over movies. All of it was a lot to process, and I'm glad we had the chance to do it together. On Wednesday, we all grabbed breakfast at the pancake place with yummy eggs before he headed off West towards friends.

Haha, take that, I am learning to keep things broad to the extent that I don't think it affects narrative recordkeeping but also it generalizes the experience to a broader audience. The downside is less relatability upon my own review (without photos), but I'm thankfully coming away from this as a necessary business tool. Just getting it down for therapeutic stress relief only.

Rest of the days was pretty intense work up to the statutory end of week turnaround date. I am so thankful the Commission followed my drift to escalate to relevant staff for a more comprehensive perspective. It means a lot that they are genuinely putting material talent and resources into thoroughly examining our systems.

Lol, the work got so hard on some nights that I caved and popped into a trial of YouTube Music just to keep the energy flowing. While I thoroughly enjoy the time there, I'm thinking about dropping the gym membership and just using local equipment + a pair of running shoes. I just cannot for some reason get over the constant centralized music, and I appreciate my ability to identify this challenge after a year going there.

Praying for some alternatives to squats that will keep my legs strong, but everything else should be simple enough to do with minimal free weights. Thinking it'll be trivial to set something up in the garage, which has the added benefit of being sorta chilly. Hope Kayla keeps her inspiration to go with friends and such thereafter, because she is doing an awesome job staying on top of things.

Really appreciate the nature around us. So cool to see the municipal improvements at such a meaningful time. And god damn the stars are just gorgeous no matter how you look at the constellations.

Lastly, K and I went to the fair today which was awesome! We saw tons of animals, and I absolutely loved watching some equestrian practice. So fun and K loved the little bunnies, goats, and even cows!

She also got a little pig that matched the real ones earlier today in a parade to the fair! That was pretty cool to experience, and it was honestly bigger than the 4th of July one in the OBX. So interesting to see so many tractors in one place!

We had fun going through the food trucks and experience stands, where K got her special strawberry root beer and elephant ear sugary delight. We had a blast looking through the portable carnival rides and community baby show lol. So appreciative of her staying on top of the loop in re local things which literally don't even have websites!
