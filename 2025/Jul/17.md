It's been perhaps one of the most progressive internal weeks of my life, which comes with its own common consequences. Lately I've been bringing back flowers from small walks I take in between working items. I keep them on my desk and can tell how long it's been since a refreshing walk since the flowers are lively or decayed.

I'm glad I've been able to take some more time to think about the good situation I've been struggling with. It's been about time allocation largely, and I've come to recognize that I need to give more consideration to how I spend my time. I'm very thankful for Dad who talked with me about all the stress I've been going through on Tuesday night.

I just always have all these important people I want to get everything right for. But lately I've come to recognize that I can largely overthink much of my efforts. It's pretty clear this is the first time the SEC has looked into anything we're working on, and that's relatively disappointing given the years of outreach on policy work.

Them, and the SDF, it seems, are largely focused on their own working items and don't proactively explore the efforts I put in. I was really surprised by this until I thought about my own interactions with Enrique and Christian's repositories. As examples I interact with them a ton, but I rarely go out of my way to actually help develop things.

Even Jun Luo's work, which I use all the time, or Orbit, the core of block explorer interfaces. They are all incredible items but not something I care enough to directly support unless I need a specific thing fixed. Along these lines, I've come to greatly understand the vast scale of economies.

Largely through the nonattention from the Commission, I've had the chance to reflect on just how vast their operations are. The insane amount of firms they oversee with a mammoth working team. It's just one small fraction of the economy at large, and it makes me remember just how vast everyone's collective actions are.

I think about my wishes to bring the world towards a streamlined asset management system. To consider a global currency (or at least single financial system) which solves the needs of everyone. And it's all growing out to be so much more than I originally bargained for eight years ago.

The _Creative Types_ song from AnimatedJames comes to mind where he sings that he "just thought it would be nice, to not have to pay the price." I know it sounds crazy because it's already been so long, but I'm coming to recognize just the huge lifetime of work that lies ahead of me to achieve these society-changing goals. It makes me think back to the easier times of simple trading even through the inefficiencies of central brokers, when everything was so much easier.

It was a choice I made, to pick mission over money. A choice I keep making. And now I'm just holding on praying things will fall into place.

It's in my mind as this incredible reality I'm thankful to envision. One thing with it is that I'm only really accountable to the market, which I can only interpret through myself. And I find I get really hard on myself 💜

But I've come to realize with this SEC work and even the Stellar applications that others aren't that hard on me. They see me and my work as a neutral observation in its context. And even though things might not always go flawlessly, I feel that I am always putting my best hoof forward to become the most exceptional person I can be.

Kayla reminded me today that these things take time. I enjoyed a moment on her chest after we took a break to play Mario Kart. It's had to have been months since I had the chance to just relax like that.

I am thankful for the time to come back to my center and keep designing TAD3. The staff were great about isolating those innovative parts from the legacy oversight framework. It might've been so much effort to get things together, but I had the chance this morning to really wash all the corn off the car in a clean that was coming for at least half a year.

Those hours in the morning were some of first separated from work, a constant thinking job which has been all the more stressing as I think larger lately. But that was my time, and now is my chance to get back on my own pace. I really appreciate that independence which comes in part from the close community ties.

We had an awesome meeting last week, going very deep into the next morning. That chat had me going hard all the way into the Friday discussion with the SCF public goods community. I know all these projects have been years of work, but I think I'm learning to take them a little more relaxingly.

I can see that pieces are falling into place, and the people I care about are returning such favors. We all aren't completely committed together yet, but I think the proposal at least from Monday gets us all along the same ethos. She was so happy and empathetic when everything came together then, even though I'd been bedridden just figuring out the final regulatory nuances.

I'm so thankful for her and everyone else, for giving me the confidence to take this shot into the heart of legacy capitalist systems. She's helping me start a new rule that I think makes a lot of sense after the drive home thinking Tuesday night quite strenuously. I've concluded that the challenges I've been facing these last months around complete exhaustion stem from having too many human conversations.

It's just a lot to process all that information for me, even if they are just recorded playbacks. I have so much experience with it, and now that understanding has grown so much that I just overanalyze every tidbit of the flowing minute. I'm extremely good at figuring out the dynamics, but I've come to understand that that's not entirely the most important outcome when standing and progress time matter more than interpersonal politics.

On one hand this is exceptionally relieving, as I can just go back to focusing on the engineering work. And on the other it means completely letting go of a whole portion of my psyche that's been on overdrive for so long. Interpreting public releases, analyzing every waking detail, and bringing myself into deep pools of reflection at night.

I get to relax from all that now and just take my time and space because that's what leads to the quality output that everyone's waiting for. I know some of them want things pushed through faster, and I appreciate their eagerness. They're all really great, and I know I struggle on the monetization side for due preference towards efficiency and protections.

I'm going to figure it out with the help of the market. And we're going to grow so that everyone's involved. Because I appreciate the breadth of understanding and unique specialization I've acquired, and I now look forward to spreading the load off my shoulders.

Not long ago Chives commented on the silliness of hidden agendas. I think everything will just be easier with my materials out in the open, including this repository. So, from here on, I say let's just let it all hang out, because it looks like everything's tending towards that way anyway.

I think back at all those formative lessons, and I compare myself to the flawless execution I know I'm capable of. I appreciate this confidence and understanding. But now I want to just accept things for how they are and keep moving forward.

I've helped a lot around the house lately, like doing a ton of dishes given no washer lol. I know it might not seem super related as I consider this more public transition, but it matters a lot to me. I appreciate the ability to take some rest away and just make the house and world around me a little better for the people I care about most.

I also helped her with the car tires, and she was sweet enough to retort back with a big penis drawing on my whiteboard. I'm glad I have the leeway and freedom to continue voicing all these parts of my life. I remember how much it affected the tenor of Insull later in his life without the pussy of a supportive partner.

I think it's a little vulgar, and I'm trying to edge more towards respectful chat in the bed. It feels so much nicer after the chat we just had where she accepts my focus on work so far as to not focus on managing her retirement assets anymore. That was really a big drag which introduced... a lot because of how much I care about asset management, and I feel really good to be completely free of all managerial thoughts after the transition is done.

For the first time in a long time, I feel like I'm at the helm of an actual transfer agent company, which I'm increasingly understanding has a distinct capital-conscious role to play outside the nonprofit. The questions from staff were really helpful in clarifying these materials and reviewing all our strategies. And it really gave me some space to materialize the honesty and discipline lessons from the trip to G&G Wooten for the 4th.

Their beach journey was some memories I'll never forget with family. I think of the time Christopher and I were intervening on a magical night at the beach, which felt exactly like embracing a free market for the first time in a long time. It parallels so closely with the exceptional outreach I was fortunate enough to get across for the public goods funding setup which I am excited to help blossom into so much more.

And fwiw, I've continued to really appreciate the brony music inspirations which, while separate, help me contextualize my work and process my decisions. That and some time on the swingset are the two things I've locally found to help take my mind off the deepest work. It's been magical in drawing me back to myself when there are so many expectations looming from all sides.

I look at my knuckle and calluses from the swing chains and remember that everything comes down to my intensity. And I've been bringing that as far in as I can lately to just be myself. There have been some autistic outbursts here and there lol, but I trust the backstop I have in my friends' respect.

It's nearly been two years since we all really started connecting, in just a few more months. I know I'd be in a really different place without them. Probably back in that centralized world of constantly chatting with just about everyone.

That social expectation was why I just couldn't bring myself to centralized asset management. And I'm so happy and appreciative that I've been able to build things out to date without mandated conversing. I look ahead with all the warnings just about everyone has shared about the sustainability of this style, and I wonder at the vast opportunity I have to set an exceptional precedent in organizational arrangement here and now.
