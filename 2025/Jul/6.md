Awesome couple days with Grandma and Grandpa. Christopher being here has been awesome, too! Glad to spend some time with Dad until he left with Karina this morning.

Via Grandma, and we had an awesome time golfing all together yesterday. Everyone hit awesome shots on the front nine. Then Dad, Karina, and I did the back nine. Dad seemed really happy to have that experience together, and I had an awesome time watching the incredible sunset off 16.

Dad dropped his Wayfinder on 15, and I had a fun mini adventure going back to snag it. Lol the whole driving part seemed like a kart game because I accidentally bumped them in the 9th tee box! And even walking half the holes with Christopher so Grandpa could ride was super enjoyable.

Lol will never forget our times over the years riding on the back of the kart. Got to enjoy that a lot between these holes. Great time with family even if a silly outing event.

We were supposed to tee off earlier in the day, but Christopher, Grandpa, and I went to grab the seafood for our incredible feast last night. We got shrimp and scallops at the familiar butcher before trapping ourselves in the departing tourist traffic for near an hour. It was great conversation back home as the Tesla drove us through the single lane forward.

Been awesome filling in the details of everyone’s stories these last few days. Turns out the IRS bankrupt guy was Grandma’s dad, from the pre-war industrial days. Crazy how the banks took so much through that decisive action.

Also understand how Grandpa really only partook in the Cold War. He told me today about handling of nuclear weapons. He was just shy of being on the pilots to guide them out, but by that point I think he was too high in the chain of command.

One thing that really stuck out was their extreme caution near the warheads. One mechanic dropped a wrench on a payload in the hangar in New Hampshire, and the whole nation freaked out apparently.

He was particularly skeptical of the extreme cautions surrounding electric aircraft work which I found stunningly interesting. Every time they wanted to do anything to the plane, they unloaded the bomb in a lengthy process and took it quite some distance away from the plane. Then they would do their temping work, even if it was just a tiny wire change in the cockpit far away.

Only then could they bring the bomb back into the aircraft to mount for final delivery. Grandpa put it as avoiding that 0.00000002% chance that something went wrong, on the basis of orders from higher up. He commented on how it took 15 minutes at least to get the payload out of carriage position, when the Russian subs could deliver missiles in under 12 minutes.

He didn’t have much to comment on Bataan except for that they tried to stop atrocities like that. I did ask about the moving process, where he explained that they couldn’t bring furniture or household items to the Philippines. By spending their money on the cheap items there, they stimulated the local GDP.

Grandma had a crazy story when he came back home and had all the items they’d acquired shipped back overseas, without any taxes of course. They got them in a DC warehouse until they had to bring things home. So they advertised local newspaper for a garage sale and had a _massive_ turnout.

The neighbors couldn’t believe it, and some of the printing got messed up so he was overloaded by buyers the instant he woke up on the first day. And then they had it saying more sales after it was over, where he managed to sell every other tiny scrap brought back from overseas. And the last minor bit of rubbish was on its way to Goodwill when Grandpa was ambushed again and sold every scrap of what was left.

The neighbors tried to flip his goods after all the furniture went very quickly. They were so interested in his items, even the ones from before the Philippines when packing up. And he just flushed it all out, two houses’ worth of crafts.

Pretty darn cool they still have a lot of this stuff at their house. Lasted for so many decades, and so clearly made by hand over and away from our locale. It makes me sincerely appreciate the longevity of the choices I made to build a material world around myself.

Yesterday Christopher made a fun cake. He was great helping with the cooking all these days. It was plum with a bourbon frosting, and everyone including Dad really liked it.

I’m on that infamous rope swing on the hammock now, and I just appreciate so dearly everything this moment has brought me over all these years. I was swinging here at 16 when I came up with the goal. And I’ve never been more excited to follow it into completion.
