Yo K has been making the most amazing mochi pancakes! Wow these are so good; it's been too long since I had good pancakes. Lol these aren’t really technically edible because I saw there is a little sugar in the powder mix bag, but honestly I'm thankful for having just the tiniest smidge of flexibility on this lately given food constraints.

K was pretty awesome and interesting last week because she had hit a limit with the intensity of the SEC work. Lol she was like "just make your own food," which resulted in a dozen pints of Nick's at the start. But after a cream-induced dairy-ache on Monday, it was nice to start attempting to bring some food items together myself. I remember I used to make desserts and casseroles galore during Uberman with all the time and caloric necessity.

But I've (thankfully in a way) moved myself past that use of time, at least to the extent that it doesn't help at all to dissociate from working thoughts. The lack of a dishwasher for the last year might have a factor to do with this, but it was a developing trend even back in Atlanta. Oh yeah, I realized that I've now doxxed my whereabouts on that this is a public repo LOL.

I'm thankful for the awesome spread K made for a Disney date night last evening. It was Mulan and she was just the cutest pouring a pot of tea. Lol she worked so hard and always has to do all these great things together, and I really appreciate all the time she finds to pull it off.

I remember and even revisited my efforts planning family events in prep for Christopher's visit next few days. I remember spending hours back in Atlanta getting things set up so everyone had a great time without a thought in the world. It helps me recognize that all jobs have meaningful work behind them, no matter how minor they might seem.

Limegreen and Shroomy have been trying to explain this to me for some time, and I appreciate their idealistic dedication in the face of nonreactions or support. Something along the lines of everyone trying their best to help push society forward. I really think it's possible if we remove the entrenched option to live entirely off the efforts of others while actively detracting from social well-being.

Also, I've been getting much closer to understanding my challenges with conversations lately. I've tried limiting external (non-Kayla) chats to once a day, and generally continuing to avoid public spaces. It's been working pretty well, and I haven't gone off the rails yet :)

One strategy I've appreciated is waiting until the end of the day for conversations, including written outreach to non-family audience. And family extends not to my parents or relatives because even those are sadly nonpersonal to the fullest extent of a partner I don't have to keep a story with. Lol she was pretty excited to go get the ring sized yesterday even though I bitched a lil about the place.

I'm starting to see more of my pending actions as asset management decisions, and specifically getting back into the mindset of properly allocating capital to _people_ in the pursuit of shared good objectives. It's kind of exciting because it's way easier for me to completely flesh out the ideas behind something than get into the gritty AI-generation. I'm quite thankful GPT-3 didn't exist for most of the time I was writing TAD3. And practically none of it was actually completed thereby even on the brief tail-end after, since we were on to interfaces by then which I still can't wrap my head around. I think it's a lot better because I had to understand absolutely everything myself, given it is such a crucial foundational piece of the whole TAD model.

Thankful to take things day by day right now. There are so many moving pieces which have so much pending action, which is great for progress on one hand at least. Probably my last chance this year to penetrate masculinely some of the bureaucratic policies, so I just want to take things slow and get it right so that the DUNA work has an exceptional foundation.
