I am thankful for Kay,a working to make sure we can afford living and things. At G&G Wiooten's house right now and they've been super fun. Grandpa taelling all stroies about how granmda aswas so helpul making lots with real estate sales back when a corlnoel in DC.

Learned today what I've heard before but forgot lol. THey changed the nkadnign system so that on ly 1% or so mithign of the conrols could be rated 1, and gradnpa awas the only one to get 1 by all 5 reviewing (generals)>) ., and he sidd it for like multiple hears. they tried to make him a general, but said the pay raise wasnt enought ot outwweight moving from DC and the "millions" fgrandma was bringing in.

Made me thin kabout how people are motivated by tmoney above personal missionn oftentimes. IT really him me in the uber from Norfolk airport yesradys to G&G wooten clubhouse. Had good vconversations that dahy without working items on mind.

The driver weas in the miniliatry Navy and had been to 32 differetn coutnries. I gave them info about what I work on with the markets, fund, and politics. They were smart and went though al l the questions you;d expect - cool to have smart people convinced by technical designs.

Anyway after talkign business, we got into personal things. He had a family and lots of experience dating; told me to stay loyal to keep trust. eThen he remarked that most people dont do what they really want to do, just something that makes money.

He asked what I'd do if mney was no object, and obviously I said what I'm going. He thought wthat was super craczy isnnaneo. I didnt realize so many epople are trapped in this system chasing money as an end.

I had a good week finishing up some high level pilocoticinkg and the ndocumetnation. IT started with the public goods award launching on Friday in earnest. That's when discudsisiions really started heating up , and I was finally able to lay the first tracks over the years of setup work.

Aftert an ninitial introduction, I let the conversation florw in to the weekend. Johan brought up all the points that struck on enigneering fronts, whcih was hoenstly sick as hell. He and Phil (Tupliu) did an instnatly good job back and forth, and I can;t think of a better person workign on the nonprofit free software for open reacrach to champion therese prinincples.

Thoughout the weekend, I was thinking on everythgin really really hjard. Ton of monvies, insane amoutns of food, and a lot of walks. 

Those walks have been getting more and more insnae laterlhy as iv'e don a lot since my last reflectionday. That means lots of mucisc., which I've been using to epxlore the light v dark sides of passion. I find it clear that daylight generally brings passionate uplifting music while the night brings fdreams into a primal stream of raw emotion cutting into action.

I finally udnerstand the extremems of nightmare ngihgt adn daybreaker in a way I just didn't get before, where the balance not only completeds the pucture but actually comes from its original vision. That is to say that , so long as you don;t cross the line, there is joy to be found in both given due consideration. Pretty nifty and really gives me the freedom to embrace all parts of who I am to output the best work-prudcuts.

it's a real newfound sense of wholeneess thats come from  all this, and I appreaicate that greartly. 

also had fun talking to the family wiating at the gate. they were also going to corolla and genrally was a fun and interesitng group. another lead poeeped in hwod had niteresting experienceds in DC housing programs

Anyway, afterh the wekeend of lettings things mature and fucking growing like a weed in my mind,  I sat down monday morning to really hgt the cinceher. Crazierst part is I barely put inthe genersis on Friday on a whim. I was really considering delaying it, but now I know that I made the right decision becuase literlaly no fuckign way I would have hte influeince I wield now if I pushed it off even a few hours.

Really appreacite that the best work jsut finds its wasy to me in important momemnts and waits for my cincing attack. And ofc being insnatly prepared for all these circumstances donesnt hurt. Anyway, I got my points in with one single death blow.

IT took a lot of contrmeplation that mornign and some pretty knarly walks. But man wehe n I sent that boy off, IO just knew it was a missile filled whith fire. 

I can tell it went well because nobody said a goodsmna thing for hours. Thane silence cmae in and substantiated my points. THanks a fucking ton for that Tim!

WIth those in conjunction with Phil's tweet, it was pretty clear they;d have to take it serously. ANd ithey did to such a large extend thtat htey complrelty changed the formatting of project review and delayed the voting deadline by a week.

I really wanted to get the deadline extended, but I had to make the points subvertly given space and politicla bandwith contraints. ANd I am so pfucking happy and greateful I got it done! That was a makor win, any way you slie it.
