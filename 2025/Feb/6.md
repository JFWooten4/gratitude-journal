Been just over a week since I dropped inhere, and what a great week it's been! Had an wespme chat wiht James last noght, and I;msothankful to gind thede incredible self-organizing and self-inceitized communitis around buildign a better market. I've also had quite the incredible past birthday weekend. First we Had Dad on Sat followed by AUnt paatty on Sunday. I gave htem bth quick calls tnad they were jus so swweet and happy to chat.

I hope Dad's having a fun time skiing in farawayland. I really wanted to plan a whoe triup out to Denver to use the last couple days at some of the big rockies resorts. And I love and cherish those memories from when I was growing up. Hipefully I'll have hte leeway to enjoy a lot more of that when I grow up (i.e. make neogh to support Kayla nad myself).A few outstanding paid thigns to do like the Stellar grant, but I've sort of humerously noticed that I just couldnt care less about the centralized cleint-relationships that pay the corporate money.

I read someones page the other day, person who did the Reinventing Orgs video series. They said the business model jsut doesn't feel right, and I tihnk that's how aI approach a lot of public-utility bankign services. These things just need to exist and function for the use of all without immense conlifcting interests and legacy business models. But hey, I'm looking out one of the most feorgous windows of my life right now, and I suppose it's tiem to appreacite that.

I went on a walk the other day for a couple hours, down the road and to the rail trail. But this time I ventured past the terminus, down to the river. I found a fallen tree overhanding the creek and sat there for a while, enkoing the bliss of natural serenity all around me. I heard water streaming by acrosss the rocks while bird cawed in the distance. It was so silent and untouched, with not a single city or car noise to be heard. THe farms nearby were distant thoughts with pristine landscapes flowing endlessly into the river.

It was nice ot sit and be one with nature and its desires momentarily. So much of our world orbits around these decentralized autonomis systems, and I wonder just how incredible a future might be where we can offer these special moments at nominal cost to anyone in the eocnomy. _The economy_, what a fun way to look at all work.

## Kayla Birthday

We ad an awesome trip out to Cincinatti where we first visited the food market. Then we got to ride th etrain downtown and walk along the majkor riverbend. We had a great time winging on the park benches hung from above, poking fun at the landscapes and comign ship. So long and comparative to the rudder state we passed shortly after. 

Walked around muhc more to a plethora of bakeries, adding to our treats from the food bar earlier. K was so happy to have a chocolare-straberry cream=puff tart from a french bakery. Then we walked through uptworn where she found a fun macaroon shop that was apparently the best in the whole world of all birthday treats she's had!

Next, we walked througn a fun park downtown by the theatre until our French reservation at a very special place. It was on the corner of the park, and a joy to uncover. K had the most excquisite ravioli and beef tartar with escargoe I've ever seen, and she was such a happy baby. :)

## All Friends

I've really come to peace with myself latealy in my growing role as a change advoate bringing everythign foward. It feels so nice and natural to live in this sdynamic market assigning values by prejct worth. ANd man I just feel so at home in both my daily life and going into work.'

All I want is to put in some more hours, which is partly why I;ve been sacking over on the thankfullyness. But tere's just been so much abundane flowing my way that I had to come appreciate it. For instnace, Mom got her eannual bonus and was so excatic that she couldn't depoitit via moile bank app. She gave me a call and sent a hundred bucks to use for a special Valentien's outing. So sweet and thoughtful.

And then how could i gorget all the incredeidble last few dyas of work along The Great Taking with some sawesome action in the State courts. Truly just incredible.\\

Were going to make this work, and I am so so very thankful for that. 

LLove universe, love people. Started donating to free.law and Trunorth - just awesome feelings to really give back in best ways I can with work and funding. I admire the beatu of our societal organizations as gems of the past, and know these are the perfect foundations to build our new dsitributed worlds.
