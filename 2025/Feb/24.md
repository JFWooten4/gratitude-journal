Been nearly a week, and what an awesome time it's been. Getting the TAR comment written and decentralization furthered with the community. Awesome end to the week with my own free markets reflection. Got to spend practically all day figuring that out, which was awesome without central management.

Before leaving for Vegas with K on Saturday, I super connected with a lot of the canon and brony RD work.

Going as hard as I want to, and just awesome Vegas.
