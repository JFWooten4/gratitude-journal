Had the rest of some chickpea pasta today, which led to head same as some time back. Really _should_ be working on the commentm but man Im just exhausted/.  Had a bit of a pleasant interruption today when K came into my office and practically begged me to pound her lol.

I remember her doing that all the time back at the tail end of college, and it's nice toget back to that feeling again. She's so femanine, andI love it so so much. I really hope things r gonna work well when I run out of money in a couple months lol.

I know it will all be OK no matter what happens. I'm still so hingent on thenumbers in the world around me lol. I just know things are going to be so so muc easier now that we have the Community. And man it wouldve seriously been so different if I found them just a litte bit later.

lol i remember so vividly that chat with Chives the moning of the discussion with VC bigshot. man am i incredibly thankful for all the smart people circa there and how he keeps everything so nicely together.

I feel a lot like twilight getting her wings, and had a nice moment to recollect on such about an hour ago. Was nice to enkjoy some childhood pasts and reconnect with early experiences. Damn man I lterally was back to picturing RD when with K earlier today.

That work of pastel equines has influenced me so deeply,. It was there for me when everyone else left, and it showed me such a magical better way. God I dont know who those writers r but they need a lot more money

abundance, waht isn't it?? i know we can hve it online, and now Limegreen is talking me into having it in person. it's crazy to think about applying or work toth real world; about running entire global economies on friendship
