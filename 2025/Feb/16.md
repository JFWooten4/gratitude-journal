Just nut. Had an awesome last few days for Valentine's and getting the bulk of the prep done for the masssive TAR writing week, esp. now that all the wind-doown prefacing is completed. I'm so excited to get that drasfted using the writing ksills I've been honing for so many years now. Type type type with my internal motivation and neverending clock of pressure! Will be alarming an hour or so out here and there, but that;s all because I ant to stay in the writing zone all week long and ignore antything outside my action items.

Really fun few days with K. On valentines we exchanged gifts. SHe got me a big basked of Pokemon and lvoing items so thoughtfully organized and selected together. Was so exciting to see everything she loved picking out for me. And the smile on her face was incredible when she saw her stuffed animal bouque.

Fun socks I got to wear all weekend while p[laying with the jigglypuf she found as herself. So cute and sweet as we did the silly netflix specials and such on the couch. Then we got to go to the awesome fanciest dinner in town at Joneseys. She ahd such a fun time navigating there with me in the nightime adventure.

Great being treated nicely and accepting the investment into my life which supporte exceptional work. Got another true spare water jug from the stre alongside a fun plan phoney for the office.

It looks super ncie next to the completeled _Invisibile Hnd_ wiht distirbuted bright lighting. Nice peace item in the office which gets all going with me. SO glad to have her and the incredible communit. 

Takimg back my respect and excited to excel


Also got to listen to lots of Audible at the gym adn while cleaning up the driveway frm a ton of snow. Super fun to run around in the nightuem while K wathes happily frm the wndow, 

Beatful place we get to enjoy together, and so glad to continulaly support each others in an unward spiral of societal prdocutivity. God I appreciate so much her belif in my vision and enablement of the inital (and largelly ongoing but diffenrtially on the individual basis) nonnprofit systems onfiguration with longstanding governance to maintain effcicincy. So cool to hear people talkng about things as if securities will "be on TAD3" as they metnally differentiatet it from the underlying tech - compelyety mindboggling givne it's just what I've been encodifying into existance over the past many years\\

It feels good to be dominance, to lead the pack, and to see the future before I rbing everyone else towards the coming realty with our growing support

We're going to do this. Now isthte time/ This is the momnet. I chose to RISE here and now, to shoot my intro to a ommission begging no its hands and knees for something that will save the hundreds of millions of investotrs presently facing tremeendous risk.
