Just nut. Had an awesome last few days for Valentine's and getting the bulk of the prep done for the masssive TAR writing week, esp. now that all the wind-doown prefacing is completed. I'm so excited to get that drasfted using the writing ksills I've been honing for so many years now. Type type type with my internal motivation and neverending clock of pressure! Will be alarming an hour or so out here and there, but that;s all because I ant to stay in the writing zone all week long and ignore antything outside my action items.

Really fun few days with K. On valentines we exchanged gifts. SHe got me a big basked of Pokemon and lvoing items so thoughtfully organized and selected together. Was so exciting to see everything she loved picking out for me. And the smile on her face was incredible when she saw her stuffed animal bouque.

Fun socks I got to wear all weekend while p[laying with the jigglypuf she found as herself. So cute and sweet as we did the silly netflix specials and such on the couch. Then we got to go to the awesome fanciest dinner in town at Joneseys. She ahd such a fun time navigating there with me in the nightime adventure.

Great being treated nicely and accepting the investment into my life which supporte exceptional work. Got another true spare water jug from the stre alongside a fun plan phoney for the office.

It looks super ncie next to the completeled _Invisibile Hnd_ wiht distirbuted bright lighting. Nice peace item in the office which gets all going with me. SO glad to have her and the incredible communit. 

Takimg back my respect and excited to excel
