Got to go skiing at Mad River yesrday - wow big fun! It's a nice hill with some fun basics. I enjoyed loopig around everyting utku U fgiybd the steepest parts. Aslo really enjoyed the Cabin at the base, which had a great view of the omtnain,
Very open space and overall nice little area. Kinda fun t be able to walk between the lifts given proximityi. Very interesting to see the houses and tr=errain near everything. Culdn;t believe the drive up which passed the Ohio Mines thing.

The mines were the coolest underground cavern with spcial rock dripplings. Today K and I are finally going to ride the special pony raunche nearby. SO excited to see her experience with them. Yay for being abe to indepndenlty plan things and just make a fun realtiy i nthe phsycial enjoymentswe get.
