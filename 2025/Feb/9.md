Got to go skiing at Mad River yesterday—wow, big fun! It's a nice hill with some fun basics. I enjoyed looping around everything until I found the steepest parts. Also really enjoyed the cabin at the base, which had a great view of the mountain. Very open space and overall a nice little area. Kinda fun to be able to walk between the lifts given the proximity. Very interesting to see the houses and terrain near everything. Couldn't believe the drive up, which passed the Ohio Mines thing.

The mines were the coolest underground cavern with special rock drippings. Today K and I are finally going to ride the special pony ranch nearby. So excited to see her experience with them. Yay for being able to independently plan things and just make a fun reality in the physical enjoyments we get.
