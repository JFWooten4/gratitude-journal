Just been super thankful for Dad's material efforts to make sure I hav a fun time down here in FL with him. He's been really sweet in all these last couple days, giving me free reign for anything we can do. Yesterday we stayed up late eating his special sausage keto crust pizza. Lol that wa a pretty awesome time wathcing Dexter !

Before thne, we went to a concert at a nearb ampitheater. THat was a geat time out together which was a really nice time off to relax together . He  seemed so happy to see all his banks.

Today we got to got to an awesome hocket game where the local Panethers just shimmed off from winning. It was Karina's first hoey game, and so fun and exciting to see the decelopments there together. Also got ot meet up with Joe and Shane from Dad's firends who were at the concert club having a ball. Plus we saw a crazy storm from the inside.

After, we got to drive around the everglade area before making out way back to the shore. Dad found an awesome stonecrab restruant there, adn we arte away on the sunsetting patio toghetrer. they seemed to hae so much fun with the seafood delights there while I metiocraclity shouffoured around :)

Chives also was just a massive help on so many fronts today, connecting all the dots between myself and others to take everythign to the next level. Super appreciate him and cna;t wait to hear about the awesome devleopments htey have tommorow on the special DAO discussion.

been noticing the improtance lately of what I focus my attention on. Back to a position of respect and authorirty in tlocal communities. It's a nice feelign, and i'm happy to have some newfound social cpaital to dole out. Longing hipefully for hte days of asset managenment anew, and steppign confidently in the direction I choose to make it happen with everyone waiting to hear my voice.
