Pretty crazy day yesterday fater the reflecton whih was ollwoed y a chat with Hinter from the stellar community. Sometimes when I hve really good chats with people, I can lose a grip on my workflow thereafter, trembling back towards music binges as motivational tools. It's interesting because it just takes a lot from my levels to speak, es[pecially with strangers about actual interpersonal topics (with a focus onthem).

I appreciated the Cutco experience growing up, where i first saw this in action at a full-on scale. It was a great chance to undrstand the nuances of interdependeant refferal sales channels and self-assigned working systems.. Here I am on the verge of something like thq again as I need to attracg more and more people to work on TAD3 nd the Syhndicate.

I appreciate the exmple of Vizziepop as sowing me outside of Newell the quandaries of a signle figurehead. It's really interesting to contrast the undercapitalization of one group with the overcapitlization of the other, stemming most interestingly fromproprietary software. I'mg getting to the point where i'll ultimately turn everything ovr to the community, and it's a big step!

I said the same to Kayla about marraige the other dya, and she took pause from it. (In the relatinship context) I guess I have a lt that I[ll be putting on the line relativeyl soono, and honeslty it;a sortt of invigorating becuase it's ne of the few actions I've got left. There's just so much that needs to oh=happenm and I can;t think of any other traction avenues I hjave control over.

It's been sp many ears now, and truly there's just always so many exciting things to od, exciting things which haven;t happpened yet because of the presengt single bottleneck in advancing action - ymyself. Yesderday night we got to celelbate the end of a gloriful day by going to inner in donwtwon Cincy befire enjiyung a hijey gane fukk if fire, fights, and fast goals. K was so happy on the way back gettng ice cream and passing out on the couch, and I jst want to have that satisfacion of a joint collective working seamessl to all the apes best able to develop.]
