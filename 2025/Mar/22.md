K did a double on Wednsday where hse worked from lke 8pm to 8am, and it was realy crazy. Then she was up for ovr 4hr when she wet back into work or a firs-shift retireent party. Wo - and then she was staying up late again last nght o get ba on hr normal seep shedule ater a uper log tie lving off Monste energy drinks.

She's ue dedatd and just an incredibvle person, ansd been s aweseome lately when I sad I ede dsome tie to get ready for marraige gven shes ony the second person 've been with. It's just been a big austign step ---- one whhich I'm sure wold've come much earlierr if we got tt orgial SCF grant --- movig towads complte cmmittment. 

i uppose it's been a coupe of weeks, i whcih time iI took a ski trip out to see Chives, which was laterr comandeeredd by Dad. We spet that full weekend inuto Tuesday after St. Partrick's  together, and I'll be back to see hi mi nFl to  scube next week. K commented, and I agree, and I'm barely getting any time ti do actual work, which feels a lot like college.

I'mm done trying t keep satisfying my paarents, andd give into easy fun activitiies jut becuase they'd otherwise b expensive to d indepndenly. iAnd I fuchking mean that for these dan credit-card and bank offers too, the former shift being ht el arger imedarte development after K's Amex crap.

Also been thinking these times off havve been taking the place of real reflectioon days,, which is nicce in a relaxing sense - bug negative for my grwth. THis want to keep to extensively-plannd short-burst faily trips via the master artist K, nd just let therest focu around explicit short-term holiday travel. 

i'm not sure hwere that leaves Dad, ut I love te guy and I', sure he'll lfigure itout. Challenge is that I have a hard time sying no to rquets to o do thigns, and so I ustraly hoe he finds more thigns to do byt himself or with all the firends.

for isntnace, we had dinner with the Chirstmas-tree farmer Chris , who told us cool stoies liek the time hi neightbo accidnetly burned down 2500 young tres. He had a good dozens of friend of liek that, and so I beleive in his abiltiy to enteiretain himself, which i nee dto audnerstnad isnt my  bjb.

Excitd for a date ngiht with K out to a hockety hame gtongiht - seomthignshe' been itnerrestd in forever. And thankful for al the recent comuntiy support for blocktransfer cing up to the annual meeting. Gd i jut want t  et the opn-soruc istes up and goingASAP

Also very thankful for Ken, who sent an incredible refferal over whicch seems to carry itsweight in palladium. I'm more and more convincend in the cyclality of jut giing everytign I cn acros the free publci ocmuntiy forums, and gain just so glad to have ts suprt network and decentralized efforts en-mas.
