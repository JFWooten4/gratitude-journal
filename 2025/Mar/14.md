I'm very thankful for the loving relationships I get to surround myself with constantly. I've been thinking back to that time in November last year when I felt the need to dive back into MLP r34 (I'll at least try to keep dialogue here child-ish-friendly I suppose, but you shouldn't expect religious cleanliness). I suppose there was some kind of disconnect on the intimacy side then, which for just a day or two led me back down that old comfort.

She was really happy when we got back from Vegas, and surprise surprise she loved and wanted and had to find some special Prada purse while I was working lol. One thing I've always loved about her was a complete and total disconnect and disdain over my own personal finances. It was years until she even asked me anything related directly to the sort, and she's always been more than generous with all our interactions. Lol, the other day, her sexy heart gem nails swiped across my laptop screen while we were sitting together, leaving a little hairline mark. She offered to replace the whole thing, and that's happened plenty of times before!

It's nice that she has an income and sustaining early career work now, and I really appreciate her unilateral support in making home life work. But I know since we started it all she's always just wanted to be free to be herself back at home without the burdens of labor, and I've always just wanted to make that happen above and beyond any other arrangements because the Pareto principle dictates that my own results are plenty for our contributions to society.

This week so far has been an awesome time leaving Tuesday to explore Keystone with Chives. Was pretty awesome getting picked up from the airport and chatting our way out to the slopes, where he went down with his second ever adventure on skis. K was also pretty awesome giving me a quickie out the door on the couch, initiated as I was just on the edge of finishing my work on the Syndicate financials at my standing desk (and she... went down under).

God that was hot.

Anyway, lots of really nice conversation on the way out and during skiing. We did some runs together and then I went towards the back black bowls of sorts. Then we spent the night together at a hotel and went to the DUNA meeting together, which was a fun thing I hope helps foster community connectedness.

Next morning, we went on a nice walk along a river, just walking about work stuff, which honestly I've never had the chance to deeply do with anyone like this before. It was enjoyable, especially learning more about other community members.

I still super appreciate all the incredible efficiencies we share working online and enjoying the mission together. But yeah I think this and the whole concept of live connections in general can be super helpful. I'll defer much much more to interpersonal trips between small groups collectively going out for some adventure, rather than one huge central organized excursion or event for literally everyone at once.

I just appreciate much more dearly the intimacy in deepening existing relationships, keeping everyone on the same conversational ground, as large events can lend themselves to stage speaking. Thus we have introduced hierarchy not found in common group excursions with shared enjoyment in some collective action. Albeit, I'll probably need to think more about what works well for everyone vis-a-vis Chives's material injuries (but he's ok lol) both on and off the slopes.

I appreciate the flexibility remote work gives me to flip around and continue this adventure with Dad out in Vail County area. I also deeply appreciate the undying inner fire continually guiding me towards meaningful labor and decentralized solutions. I've seen those both so strongly as we discussed sentiments, goals, and values these last few days—just a whole lot of incredible potential just waiting out there!
