Been with Dad and new gf in FLL for a couple days now. I'm really thankful K's been picking up the slack back home, keeping things going. I know one day she'll have total economic freedom because of my work, and it's nice to know I can wholeheartedly support that knowing everything she's done so early on to help us make things work.

I think it's been reasonably documented in here that I've sometimes wondered about different paths, fearing a miss of the paths so tempting. I'm glad to say that's all behind me, and I find myself fully committed to the course now. There's nothing else but the path I've chosen, and I'm never looking back.

In the car ride yesterday with Dad's friends, they made the joke that from childhood / HS they would say going "forward," not straight. That's how I'm going to live from now on. It'll always be a complex shot, never straight—but I'll never stop running forward.

Running and running till the endorphins kick in, and then running some more. I hope we can get something really special going next week in collaboration with the SDF. And I pray to God that Chief Justice Robins sees the light that shines with _Alpine_.

Some days ago, when I got to the airport, Karina picked me up since Dad had a delayed flight, and we watched a movie. I was quite focused on work at the start like always, and then I found the peace and comfort that came from some fun time at home together. I remembered how incredible it felt with someone I really loved with K.

Then, we went out and snagged Dad, with some yummy tasty NoCow protein bars in the ride over because I mentioned them to Dad alongside the acquired Zevia cream soda. That was really nice, and I appreciated him planning those snacks plus all the items I partingly mentioned on the phone.

Dinner was a fun no-rice cucumber sushi, and it was just the absolute best—stuffed with fish. I appreciate Dad for that all and trying to get us on a dive boat this Sunday with everything. All the new equipment looks great in the houses, which are finally completely constructed! And then yesterday it was a complete gorgeous day.

We drove to the beach area and stopped by the Bonnet Gardens—which were super awesome, gorgeous, and artfully inspired. So cool to learn and feel the history of someone who broke away from their family money to uncover their own fortunes in creative success. Then we went to the shore at Lauderdale-by-the-Sea.

It was completely beautiful there and we saw and got some seashells that looked like the ones so delicately decorated on the walls at the manor. Had a relaxing time in the sun while I accepted solar abundance for the first time with my sunscreen. It felt incredible to just lay and relax without worry of shading from the umbrella because I knew I am strong.

Then I appreciated playing with Dad in the sea, smashing into the waves. We also had a great time walking along the beach shore, finding the beauties in Florida together. Then, we stopped by a beachside bar and everyone had a seafood happy-hour snack extravaganza!

Today was also incredible, with a bike ride into the city along the river. After that we had a French café lunch downtown where we got Karina a crème-brûlée square croissant pastry. She had a big yummy when we got back to drive to the Flamingo Gardens.

The trees there were just incredible, and I couldn't believe the one pointy pokey bark that Dad could've hugged for hours lol. They both loved all the creatures and natural beauties as we waved to ostentatious peacocks. Loved our short ride together in the freedoms of nature, and they seemed really happy about the whole experience!

Then we had an awesome lobster and salmon dinner—man it was incredible! Dad did a great job cooking everything up and bringing it all together with some great seasonings. Yum we had so much fun with the lobster appetizer margaritas.

Reminded me of the night before when we went to a rock concert with a bunch of friends incl. Joe that came over. We packed into a car downtown and heard a big rock band. Then we were back at the house partying for the night—lots of people coming together to have fun.

I loved that they were all incredibly supportive of my vision, encouraging me to "stay down the path" and keep finding my own way. That's exactly what I'll do, and it's what I saw tonight in the incredible post-dinner show production of Cowboy Bebop Live musical! Finally felt like and saw the starship blasting around in the direction of a central inspiration manifesting mission.

It was a great reminder of what matters in a condensed jazz experience of raw emotion. Thought it was incredible the way he kept steadfast on the motivating internal drive towards an acceptable tomorrow in concert. And then a great Netflix ice cream keto party to wrap things up after viewing the club row in the city center—yay!
