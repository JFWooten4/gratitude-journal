Had a really late night yesrday whic h was realtiveyl crazy after hte SYndicate annual meeting. iThings are really sttartying to come togeher with people trying to give the company money, which is pretty damng cool! Honeslty i f I just went the lazy route and set thigns up wit hot keys, it would be retty simple to start selling hardcore private market services.

Now that I'm out of fiat, I'm starting to think a lot about turning the bueinsess into a business; reall charging and making deals happen uatomatcially. If we got just those couple thigns et up, then it could turn into virtually an automatic revenue machine serving issuers and investors. Some unds flowing through in any sense porbably only helps my cases for actually having ongoing development for the ocre services needed by the whole market.

I'm thankful for the simple workload I;ve created for myself, crafting my life around my long-term goal. It's been so fulfilling retrospecticely to know that we're on this meaningful path of progress. And I really appreciated everyone showing up in spades yesterday to fuel an inspired cponversation. 

Lately I;ve been getting back into implkmeneting things, and particualrtly I've uncovered a renewed focus on just continually getting things done bar none. It's just largely meant focusing on exclusivly one thing to do at a time, and then doing that until it's done. No excuses, no distractions. And if it takes a while like some key work today, thne I just keep ging until it's done.

I like it and I reweingly committed to just continually fnsihign everything I start becuase it's better to hae the legacy background contextout there and done over lamenting for far too long while it sits on the backburner. Happen or do not happen, there is no back-stack.
