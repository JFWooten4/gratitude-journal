First day walkign around with a seed phrase. It's kind of exilerating! But mostly fairly normal.

I'm really happy I had the old kevlar string. what fun days those were. A simple, fun time showing me the magic of seconadry markdets so early one.

K was pretty wesaome toda before I left. Ton of deep head on the couch before she just took it right between those spread legs. Mh i know t"tone it donw 'and all but I am just shakin my head rightn ow how good that was.

Shes been reall cte  helping too, since i've been fill-sending out this AN comment. inally one, and I really cna't express how happy I am. So so glad they have im to review

After bbig drive here with pretty mountains, had a nice tea candlelight chat wiht mom. she brought up the standard qusitn of what's next for fnds etc. so glad to see her now and very thankful we get tis chance to bring everyone together for C graduation.

made me think - so forgive my discussion here of work but I od want to think

biggest thing Is that I "asked myself a question", which I think is my id speaking to my superego

and my id is normally right

That's why It also made me think about my recent personal proposition. I've been tring to pause and ask myself why I'm doing something" before I do it. to slow down and make intentional decisions with a local goal in mind. it was really helpful the other day in crafting a community message where I wasn't sure exactly what my implses were trying to achieve before a very brief paise

now that i thionk about it, that's exactly what i had the chance to do after a grueling edit flow today when communiting with the ocmmunity. speaking of, they are really liking this comment :) So thankful for all the serious love they've sent my way in reviewing the oc.

i was thnking today about wealth distirbution in the reflecive and learinign car ride. the beatuful sceneraery and economic uaiobooks got me going. i'm very thankful for the high standard of living we get to enjoy thanks to the immaularete technolgoies of so many years past

one that really sch in my mind was the governance work that went into making all these long routes I drove over. the prbrideds commanding tower over a riverside railroad track. and the spurratic lttle homes.

truly on he shoulders of giants, i and i just cna



!remindme perhaps I'll reflect on it once I finish all the governanc work setup
