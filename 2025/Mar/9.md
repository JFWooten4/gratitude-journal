Iknow it's been literal weeks since last checkingin here, and I can really feel it/ I miss so earnestly thedeep gratidtude for those around me granted  y this writing soltoude. And yet theselast weeks of intense central action have shaken me from routine till now.

Thankfully, I am happily back now after a tremendous travelling jourey with K. She was so wseweet thorughout our trip toVegas while speaking for the las time as Struct Finance crpa. A sector I cna't wait o see removed from economic  extraction,..

We eally had an incredile time together eatching tons of shows like a jousting tournament, VEGAS show!, and Blue Man Group (me0 v. male strippers (her). It was so nice to see he rsmiling over the locale and shiopping fun.

Reallythnakfiul for the awesome restaunts we got to enjoy together. God she loved that EiffelTower adventure,and it was so nice . 

I savor the days when it was all so much easier, back in school when everyone wanted  to dthrow money at us by the nature of our ages. when we ould thoughtlessly spend whole days together in loving bliss without hte undying pressures of making rent. 

I'm very thankful for her place of fortitude in central organaization, and I think so deeply recently as to my positioning in a more istirbuted world. I see and know quite clearly now that this is the only way togards my goal, and I appreciate so greatly the lack of external financial pressures which afforded me the freedom ot uncover so bfore shareholders had to exert their maximizations upon the Syndicate.

The fun time in Vegas was followed by a trip to Trinity for Marti Gras in New Orleans. We stayed downtown fo the first few nights and just had an absiolute blast in the episcenter of parades , people, and so much more culture. Loved walking down Bourbna steet and exploring the benie cafes with K. And took some aesome bike rides around the area to discover beatiful nature.

But none of it as beatiful as my sweet sweet girldfriend who graciously planne out such an incredible initial day with restaurants, an exceptional inner buffet cruise, and so mcih more along the streetcr routes.

Trinity was awesome and loved meeting with ehr and Boyfriend. NEW GUY WE BOTH KINDA THINK LOOKS LIKE CCHRISTOPHER LOL.

WE'VE BEEN BACK FOR ALMOST A WEEK AND IT'S ABOT TIME TO GO AGAIN FOR SOME SKIING. I APPRECIATE ALL THIS TRAVEL AROUND TO SEE POPLE I CARE ABOUT (OR EXPLORE WITH THEM). I ALSO SUPERCEDENTLY APPRECIATE OUR TIME HERE AT HOME RELAXING. I SUPER APPRECIATED THAT I WAS ABLE TO TAKE A FEW HOURS OFF TODAY AND RELAX WITH K FOR A FUN ICE-CREAM AND PIZZA NIGHT. SHE WAS SOS WEET TO SET THAT UP TODAY PLUS AN EXCITING DISNEY DINNER DATE NIGHT YESTERDAY FOR HTEINCREDIBLES.

WE HAD EXCEPTIONAL STRAK TOGETHER FROM THE COSTCO RUN AFTER TRAVEL BUT BEFORE THE CR DAO MEETING SHE ENJOYED WITH ME. 

LOVE ANDAPPRECAE HER SUPPORT OF MY WORK.

Maybe one day it'll all be easier. I'm still thinking so deeply bot how I'll likely need to use explicit capitalistic rewards to incentizie the masses to join us. I hope we cna keep it as retroacive and decentralized through inspration as possible. 

K was so sweet lately and today, continually bringing up marraige. Love her so much ndglad wehave this opportnity to make our own life together. We were two goofballs walking around everywhere in Vegas, until the last day wehen we bussed around.

The first palce we went was the claw adventure K discovered. IT was after hte awesome shopping malls at wynn and the convention area, plus an unbelievable buffet at Ceaser's/ It was what K wanted to enoy so greatly, and I'm super satified still from the wholesome meal we enjoyed together. Lol, when thyb rought out the fresh crab, K snagged two full plates of it for me <3 :)

We had somuhc leftover that I took it waway in a little cup and at it up until we walked ourselved past the bus stop to the ice rink. I know it's something she wantd to do, and it was right next to her special donut place. We walked there, and I saw her face light up like a lightbulb aswe got her creme-brulee donut. So much fun enoying that together before our trip to the funny vagina ift shop on the stirp. And then an unforgettable view fo mthe huge tower overlooking all of Vegas from the sky, while K had jher yummy bar mac-and-cheese.

The parades toeether were just incredible. So fun to have us both grabbing at hte silly beads. and to see ehr enoying herself and the food. HJer southern accent came out for a moment, and i fond it unbelivably cute.
