Before getting started, can I reiterate just how much I fucking love TA? Like holy shit, I started doing it on the time in minutes (most often) and hours in conjunction with minutes :). It is actually legitimately seriously insane.

I really really like getting flashes of "trade" inspiration when the hand crosses over to a new material "lucky" minute vis-a-vis "lucky numbers" in trading. Moreover, I've come to realize quite presciently lately that politicking is literally just trading. You're analyzing complex systems, mentally accounting for all known factors, and making a choice which is right or wrong.

It's kind of exhilarating!

I'm really thankful for the universe's path which brought me down the life journey I so enjoy. It's truly quite blissful knowing I have the strong foundations of Kayla and Stellar. They're very important pillars of my life which stand tall to support the forthcoming free market (lol feel-less but idk sounds good that way if we could get gov through a DUNA).

Very thankful for the governance innovations quite particularly from the SDF, a seriously unique initiative. In so many ways, incl. SCF here.

Okay so I'm back and man K was horny like wow nice. I'm starting to retain my energy after mid-day sessions, which I'm accounting to a more delicate balance of carbs in my diet. Ideally, I'd be back on full keto, but budgets suffice standards at this point.

On the topic of politicking, I'm finally free of any alternative paths! Thankfully, after this last comment and SEC review starting, there is literally nothing else I can meaningfully do with my life anymore! It's kind of exhilarating, because now I have to make it work.

Speaking of the comment, I've come to recognize that I've been acting like a pussy-ass bitch these last few months. I think it could stem from the frustrations I had with the asshats at Vegas. (Breath!)

It's quite a stark contrast with the community of people who actually speak the fucking truth. The trust. Something they can't stop us from spreading once the world realizes their lie.

Lol I wrote FTDs up in the review, and I can't wait to see if the Commission takes a bite at it for us.

Thanks K for yummy, my heart was jelly and yay.
