I had a nice long walk in the forest today after getting everythign in extremely last night. It was an exciting time with some great output. My reflections today tend towards the last time I;ll go so intense shot-term on a central timing.

I am thankfull for the keen work I ot to do making everythign ready before this all comes to be. IT was an increible time putting my trading skills to use to invest my own energies. This alk in the oods really helped me freflct on that and the incredible rleaitnshpi I;ve built alongside the Syndicate.

Uesterday K got us anime and an MLP rock frinedhsip shier a hot topic. She was so sweet and su[[prtoive anpit it, amd omstamt;y sp,epme ;oled ot at tje stpre we forst wpre to to together. I was so happy with it that we went tpgetjer to a nearby farm forest.

There I got to reallt think about us and everythign that's hjappened wothj tje differet communities these last few years. O appreciated htje insights nature shared as to y path so far and times to come as we adventure togehter. I ;ove jer sp ,icj and realize where things fit together now. There;s nothing I want more than to make this work ight . I;ve come ot peace and happiness with everything we have now as enojgh, because a decentrlaized life can be so beaturidul. :puple_hrat:
