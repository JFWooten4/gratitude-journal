I had a nice long walk in the forest today after getting everything in extremely last night. It was an exciting time with some great output. My reflections today tend towards the last time I'll go so intense short-term on a central timing.

I am thankful for the keen work I got to do making everything ready before this all comes to be. It was an incredible time putting my trading skills to use to invest my own energies. This walk in the woods really helped me reflect on that and the incredible relationship I've built alongside the Syndicate.

Yesterday K got us anime and an MLP rock friendship shirt at Hot Topic. She was so sweet and supportive about it, and constantly someone looked at it at the store we first went to together. I was so happy with it that we went together to a nearby farm forest.

There I got to really think about us and everything that's happened with the different communities these last few years. I appreciated the insights nature shared as to my path so far and times to come as we adventure together. I love her so much and realize where things fit together now. There's nothing I want more than to make this work right. I've come to peace and happiness with everything we have now as enough, because a decentralized life can be so beautiful. 💜
