Hello brain and thank you thank you thank you for being so smart. Seriously like my entire career exists because of you. And you are just so curious about markets for some reason after exploring the world.

It's amazing. Inspiration to say the least to a captive audience. And man I just really appreciate all the brilliance you share daily with me 💜

Today I took another look at K's picture book. I was cleaning up my office, which went awesomely. So much more organized and very relaxing working environment.

That scrapbook always makes me cry, and I love her so much. Particularly love this incredible thing she made all those years back. I can't believe we met under such inspired circumstances as the sneeze happened.

The world is conspiring to help me give masses of people real savings and retirements. And man I love and appreciate that so very much. You are awesome world, and go you!

Also, I really appreciate that I've stopped being so egocentric. I recall the days of so much focus on personal appearance. I feel at peace now that the only audience I need or want to please is the great times I have taking K out on special dates.

It was a breath of fresh air and maturity to glance over our time together all those years back. She's just magical, and I can't wait to marry her. Thank you world for everything you've gifted me lovingly.

And I guess I'm happy to report that the community park construction is coming along splendidly. I appreciate the bureaucratic forces putting everything into play now. I truly feel like those kids out there, playing around and doing everything I love each day.
