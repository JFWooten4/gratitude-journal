Very early in the morning, and just finishing up a really insane week. Prepping myself for a reflection day next few days because I've completed a lot of material work I've had in the works for years. Most recently was the first SEC audit response, with the full pretext of three comments.

And, of course, 3 days before that was the third comment itself, laying the bailout framework groundwork. So thankful and happy for the intense stellar efforts from everyone that led to this final product through the magic of Smith's hand. <3

It wasn't easy getting it all done in this tight framing, and so I appreciated a lot of RD music that pushed me through to the max as I powered on. I've stumbled on Wonderb3lts again, and it's really made me nostalgic of Kayla. That and this near-week trip has me missing her. She is so sweet, and lol sent me a TikTok of just that recently.

I want to bring the relationship and marriage up in the reflection because it's really been distracting me to not be all in lately. And frankly how much of that can even occur takes due consideration. I've always been logical about these kinds of things, which is why I find it so unique that I have a moment to tackle life's miracles now.

Also last couple days was Christopher's graduation from App State! We have had an awesome time celebrating, like when Mom made him a Scrabble message full of love. He loved his chef outfit presents and the book and pinball machine cash from everyone.

After the ceremony yesterday, we went out on the town bars. Then Christopher had Dad and Karina and me come meet him at a frat house party, which was super fun! Dinner with him and Grandma and Grandpa and Chris and his friend R.J. and everyone was both incredible and enjoyable!

Also night before, we had a party with everyone plus more of Christopher’s friends. I enjoyed talking to private-security cop-mocker fun guy from New Mexico. Some really fun stories from all their crazy experience at Walmart:
- naked ladies high shopping!
- people lying in parking lot!
- Mom's NYC growing stories

It's definitely a different use of my time which I seem pretty good at thanks to all the practice (air quotes). Things went well, and I appreciated my steadfast remembrance of K and her eternal love as we walked around places. Also, Christopher made some poker and Mom brought King Ranch chicken for the party alongside sweets from the town which made an incredible spread!!!!

We went to the town a couple times, Mom and I—walking, eating, and playing. She was fun enough to talk to and so sweet showing me around everywhere like I was her guest. I'm glad I get to enjoy these family things now while my parents are healthy, even if I wind up walking half an hour to find the gravel road's electric mainline service! :)
