Okay, so I forget how much I substantially finished before ending it last week, but the terminus was my departure Tuesday morning to Dad's for a weekend in Florida. He was very kind in repeatedly offering the second home as something for my own. I also remember him commenting during college that he'd happily room with me (presumably covering all costs) in NYC should I desire. That's 💜

He's always so generous with me and supportive of my efforts at independent organization. From the early years of helping with music production equipment to the deep support of my stock-trading habits. His influence early on with the connections and experience with Pam day trading was unbelievable.

To say nothing of the generous capital allocation and forthcoming trust on crypto custody operations, which honestly could've turned out much differently all things considered. And of course his more recent attempts at strong bonds through skyscraper views and train crossings, all from a place of genuine love.

I know others and such see a challenged man, but I just can't help and appreciate his genuine best efforts in a system so devoid of personality or individualism. Thanks Dad—lol this is why you get the dedication to the second book rather than the alt (RIP!)

Anyway the weekend extended across FL was pretty great. The first night there, we came home and made some dinner together before it was late enough for some TV. On Friday, we picked up Karina from the airport after some work in the morning. I made some great progress with the community which I'm loving as always. Even got the inside scoop on a forthcoming ape book which is upcomingly awesome!

On the way there (and before) Dad shared some bond offering docs which were useful in understanding the specie forum used by Cede in central offerings. It brought some evocative reactions from the Discord which make me smile. I asked Dad about it in the car ride, and he seemed really stumped as to the accounting schematical technical details of who owns what.

Can't wait to reach out to Webb and a plethora of others in Stellar this week. They are all so awesome, and I really appreciate everyone's work a TON! We're all going to be unstoppable quite soon in unison.

On Saturday, Dad and I went shore diving at Lauderdale-by-the-Sea. It was really fun and cool to just walk into the ocean and swim out to that neat reef. Since it was shallow, we were literally down there for two hours! I found some very nice peace that day for a few reasons.

Firstly, I started off on a tranquil Leave song. In vibing to it all morning at the behest of productivity output, I had some huge work breakthroughs. I noticed that these only came because I didn't have access to food-energy items of consumption for clerical reasons.

Then on Sunday we went on an airboat alligator tour. It was a serene trip through the Everglade boating canals, followed by a live "wrestling" demonstration and zoo enclosure. Had a blast with Dad and Karina seeing the waterborne so closely with air floats.

The last big thing was my understanding of how music was affecting my dominance frame on life without personal intention, direction, or autonomy. I started putting the thoughts into a public post, but I'm tired at the end of the day and can't uncover the bandwidth to do that with the level of care I'd even reasonably expect. I really appreciate that I just get to reflect on my reminiscent thoughts and appreciations here without the higher standards of public review and affirmative publication. It's sort of a testing ground for my subconscious that really adapts to how I well express myself, reflect, and grow upon the meaningful ideas which naturally take time to emerge while I enjoy the long time horizon availing completeness.
