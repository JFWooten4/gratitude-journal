Okay, so a full week of pretty awesome work! Things are coming together on the community front with the Stellar documentation and DRS connections to GME. Lol I had the A-team thing up earlier—"love it when a plan comes together" :)

It was also a really fun week with K. The nights we had together were sweet and kept me going on very minimal hours of sleep. I recognize that I need to put in all these efforts now to pioneer new work, but man I feel bad for the later-stage career professionals that need to do this intensity forever.

For instance, I was looking into Morgan's involvement in the 1907 crash and private rescue. Dude died literally the same year of the Federal Reserve Act from a stroke in Italy! Like how does someone die of overwork and stress in the most relaxing place I can think of.

Then you realize how much pressure they put on all these figureheads and it's like "oh yeah they want literally one person who controls everything according to our whims." Honestly a little crazy how corporate board structures work with standardized disconnect from actual stakeholders. Like damn I'm coming around to Limegreen's redefinition of what we call the law.

Friday/Saturday morning I really connected with the final terminus intentions of Webb, which was nice. Then K and I went to Indianapolis for the exciting mall adventures of swimsuit shopping. While we looked everywhere, she ended up finding some special fun things at the department store across the street.

Had a good time exploring the Legos, fun space sets on display. And then we got to go to Walmart and find some great new yellow glasses! I'm writing this one at my desk and really enjoying the little personal snowglobe she made for our anniversary.

Lol I also have the special rock heart from when we went gem mining. So much excitingness to build together ;) He always so cute and we even got to watch Disney and play Mario all night long!

Really appreciate everyone's hard work and support. People are coming out in droves to support the work of all these years. And man I've been impressed by the decentralized investigative work.
