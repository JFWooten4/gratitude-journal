1 day left! Not full through Thursday (yet), and should really be writing on the comment. But I just took a walk around the (existing prior) park, and I just wanted to take one minute.

I'm very thankful for the sense of belonging I've found these last few years running the Syndicate through the SEC. It's been so massive to uncover the in-crowd itself and become part of the industry. And I wouldn't trade what I've learned for anything <3

It's finally time to get it all out there and start performing! To enact the change and shake the games up. I love that I can feel the world changing around me :)
