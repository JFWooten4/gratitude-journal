1  day left@!  not full throgh thursday (yet),  and  shoudl really  be writgiting  on  the  omcment.  bUt I just took al walk abround the (exisitn prior) pakrl,m and  i just  wanted to take one minute. 

I', s veyr thankful for the  sencse of belonging I've found these  last gfew years running the SYndicate throgh the SEC.  It's bee  so masive  to uncover  the in-crowd itself and become part of  hte uindustyr.  And IO wounldn't  trade hwat I've learned for anything <3

It's finally  time  to  get  it all out there and starrt performing! TO enact the change and shake the games up. i  love htat  i  can feel the  world changing around me :)
