Don't have my full laptop so I won't really be able to get it all in until tomorrow night when I hope to do an extended session but I'm just so thankful. I had an incredible moment with that tonight and I feel like I'm barely progressing maturing the last remaining leg of childhood left at the helm of central direction. I finally made it out and he's also clearly, gosh something I've said so often these last few weeks and months - - seeing it all so clearly is we move into position to truly leave the church like tonight ðŸ’œ
