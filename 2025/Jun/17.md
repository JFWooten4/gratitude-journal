`What     A    week!`


Hahaha man I'm  not surehwat I epxected hte firwst exam  to be like. But  this is just something incredible. It really  was the brink of  my  reality for some of thosde ngihts.

Kayla was cleaning up the hosue throughout, and  she  kept playing around weith  me â€”having lots ofun!  but  yeha mna, I cllaled inthe ocmmunity  over hte weekend, I ai couldn't belive what we  ahcieved that ifnal day togehtr.  SO thakfull for everooyhne that iexplicabley hounded together  to  make the deadline.

I hope  the staff understandd wht I'm getting at with the centralized dealdines. I think it's rpetty  cool they;ve gone dso forward an deep into the mechnisms  here. What an item to get my agentda rolling quickly after getting back.

## trip gratiudes

I;m again jsut eally  thnakful for the itme we had togehtr. The sweet meals and daily journeys together were so nice. Annd it really  helped me forsteer a connection with the universe.

Thi sunday  actually,  i went to chirdch like i said, nad just had a really grea time relaxed inthe midst of  things. These are feeligns that have been dorman t during less exciting work for years. I;m so thaknful the  workk getting this ll together brought it out in me again.

And iloved  hte moemnets we had stogether on the plane, where hse laid against  my shoulder. Thanks  for  beirnging me across there sweety, to enjoy the service of  true champion. I looved the nice riders we took togethe into  the sunset.

## weekly efforts

IN much of the intense hours, I tuended back  on old photos K and I took otgether  all these years. I was brought to tears i nhappiness reviewing just how much we'd done  togethr. I;'m so thankful  for our connection adn this incredible life we get to enjoy.

I saw all the way back  to thosse times we  painted hsirts together. Wheen  we danced togerther in thedusk.  And I feel so warm when I see her smile brighten up my heart.
