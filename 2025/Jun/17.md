### Bliss for once!

`What     A    week!`

Hahaha man I'm not sure what I expected the first exam to be like. But this is just something incredible. It really was the brink of my reality for some of those nights.

Kayla was cleaning up the house throughout, and she kept playing around with me—having lots of fun! But yeah man, I called in the community over the weekend, I couldn't believe what we achieved that final day together. So thankful for everyone that inexplicably hounded together to make the deadline.

I hope the staff understand what I'm getting at with the centralized deadlines. I think it's pretty cool they've gone so forward and deep into the mechanisms here. What an item to get my agenda rolling quickly after getting back.

## Trip gratitudes

I'm again just really thankful for the time we had together. The sweet meals and daily journeys together were so nice. And it really helped me foster a connection with the universe.

This Sunday actually, I went to church like I said, and just had a really great time relaxed in the midst of things. These are feelings that have been dormant during less exciting work for years. I'm so thankful the work getting this all together brought it out in me again.

And I loved the moments we had together on the plane, where she laid against my shoulder. Thanks for bringing me across there sweety, to enjoy the service of a true champion. I loved the nice rides we took together into the sunset.

## Weekly efforts

In much of the intense hours, I turned back on old photos K and I took together all these years. I was brought to tears in happiness reviewing just how much we'd done together. I'm so thankful for our connection and this incredible life we get to enjoy.

I saw all the way back to those times we painted shirts together. When we danced together in the dusk. And I feel so warm when I see her smile brighten up my heart.

## Dad night

Anyway, I also had a great night with Dad. He came and we went to the Air Force museum. Saw lots of the planes that Grandpa flew way back when.

We also went to dinner together and had a sushi extravaganza. It was a pretty insane time and got me going hard the next days.

## SEC chat

Next was the day I got to present some items and thoughts to the Commission. They seemed really blown away in some aspects and thoughtfully prepared in others. It was great to blow the lid into their technical questions.

I have so much to live for now. So much on the line. I am so thankful to the gods who enabled all this and put me down this incredible path. All I want more than anything ever is to complete this needed quest.

## Weekly goals

Got to go through the Crypto Task Force meetings. I'm thankful they brought those to light to give us all confidence in making things. It's so nice to have an air of support now.

I also enjoyed some deep red-light time in the midst of relaxing to output. I've been taking more and more walks around the park lately to help center myself and find peace. It's some advice from Ankit that's helped me walk away for a brief moment of useful reflection.

## Fund things

Had an awesome gaming night with K, playing Mario Kart. It had a funny ending where we were neck-and-neck on the finish line. Just barely passed her at the last second and everyone was freaking out!! :)

Also helped a lot with dishes, keeping things clean while getting ready for Mom. I'm very thankful for all she's put into that and cleaning up the house. And so appreciative of her driving around during long hours for us.

Love you sweetie. Love the universe. Thank the world.
