Start  of a paccked week as we prep for our long-awaited trip to Cancun. I'mm so happy  we  get to do this together. Its so nice seeing everythighn fit into placce between us. I know nothing lasts forever, but I finally ffeel like I have the foudndation for all my workk thnaakks to us.

How'd it emmerge like this, especiailly givenn precedencces here? Maybe it's a cofuence of regcongizing my unique speccialization. It could be the accccumulation of all these sentimanetl gifts over the years. Mayb e it's my embracing oof God as of late.

The last poitn camme when  mym mind connectedd gifts I've been frecceiving from "the universe" to a higher power. I suppose it makes mroe sense to havve one good being in the centrlaist point o view than influence from the stars abroad. urely nobody cann fully tell the two apart, but I like the heuristic as a menas of findinng the ddestined  way.

been a pretty greaat week reconnecting with the occmmunityt and documentation work . i had sme great ineteractions with emir intte Discord, whicch makes me happy  because he connects to a whole nother sidde of the network. And the  docs just kept jchugging alogn all week.

Monday night and into Tuesday nmornig was the last crazy grind I plan en toto, whereby I reaced out to Johan and Webb via Don too. Havnet; sseen anyhhting back ffrom them yet, but genreally I love that everyonees takign theirr time reviewing TAR1. Even Josh Hamilton has been ponering on somem feedback, which hoeslt yI jsut cant wait to mmature.

Everyone seemms to be taking a holidaty circa this weekend accordig to some privatee mastermind pliotting on Wednesday. lol no postcase,, so  we hjust had a great time hopping into VC> I;'m glafd everyone iss so syncrnized along perosnal sentiments, and I;'m likign this weekly reflectioon form as a way to really keep goodness in focus.


Thrusdat had some excellent DRS discussions as we planned out the world changing .Everyone's really ecxited to implment DUNA governance and make the DAO win. Evne enjoyed a cconversation with new frinndd Drew about their backgrund which worked  out into a great back and forth about their journey into the sotnk and a beatful occeanicc careerr.

on friday, K and i made somme great profeess on asset  managemnt, andd I movved ffunddsaroun to hlpe her invvest mre. I'm glad we had so much to start iwth andd a soid base to grow together. I also got to write a thoughtful tonote to keher thhis day, outlingin some exciting owrk i get too bring accross the finish line in the focming months. <3

16 has enterd my rhetori off TA numbers as the start  of somoethign great, an that;s what I experienced yester day while running  opil change and grocy errands. after this,  i got to wlak thhro gh a eutirifl forest, feeling the incredible paths of a train around a natural sanccturary. It  had aa ive train run by a georccouss pond, and i ';ll never fortgether those freight crs glimmmering off the ater surface.

Rrally appreciate hte beatuyd of nature, which I saw unfold through GOd when starying up to make cookies after Kayla's long adayt at work. Before hten, it was so incredible to herat her flute song,, remiscing over past  days in band.  And she really appreciated me running errandds while she rested up after that sshort time out.

We also got to play two whole games of mario party  this weekend, conjoined iwth some fun movies like mario Bros and Winie  the  pooh. lol  she  was so into everything and had the head to prove it! lo lalso shee jsust came in hre and gave e kissies to "give mme a picck-me-up" for mootivation.

She;s so wweet, and i saw that today when revieiwing  osme old docs laying aroudn  the kitchen and living froom. The fir thing is her wirtten plan for our annaiversary, whicch was  hteat magic day after TAR1 when we took  the train to Metamora. It was a very lclose experience iwth my subcionsous throughout  that healign ride, and i loved  the scenery craddling us together. tTHe  back of  that was her  awesome pal n for my  birthdeay, leading up tho the pseical dinner wwe  had togehter. She really went all out to make everything perccct and seical for me :)

On the next page, she even prives  the hole thing otu to be a respnsable baby, noting the travel time  and oprating hours. WHen she has the ideas, I just can't hbelieve how well she executes on them,  completley to  my  personal deference. Since i used  to see her as an emboduemnt oft he univser, I suppose she;s now an emidiemnt of God—wcich really makes me want o fllow god old Catholicc values shared 🤝

And  then on  the back of that was the awesomme confetti cake she made for my birthday. It lays out hte magical frosting and dough recipies,  copleted  with splendid baking instutioons. I really appreciate her dediation to  suiting my wants and aspirations acorss  living aspects.

Laslt,y  i found an old postcard  note form when MOmm took ups to the Spice and Teahcc exhcange. It's a cocktail recipe using the special matcha and chile oil kaytla implements so well  in  delivious  asian meals. She just made me  a pasta with seasonigns and an aegg htat was  to die for@!

I feel coplete in every sense of hte word on  the inside. I'mm so thankful for this massive fulfillment nad lovvign  community constnatly supporting us in an endoavor to my goal obective. Buiildign real savings and retimreents for masse sof people hsa always been my guiding light, no matter how cheesy it  soundds, and I jsut ddeeply  appecaite the nuanced perspetive these last few yeears gav me on how most live so separated from the replies andd income of  the market, something  I cnat wait to globally remedy through a  path I'd never imagined years ago.
