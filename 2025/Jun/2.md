Start of a packed week as we prep for our long-awaited trip to Cancun. I'm so happy we get to do this together. It's so nice seeing everything fit into place between us. I know nothing lasts forever, but I finally feel like I have the foundation for all my work thanks to us.

How'd it emerge like this, especially given precedences here? Maybe it's a confluence of recognizing my unique specialization. It could be the accumulation of all these sentimental gifts over the years. Maybe it's my embracing of God as of late.

The last point came when my mind connected gifts I've been receiving from "the universe" to a higher power. I suppose it makes more sense to have one good being in the centralist point of view than influence from the stars abroad. Surely nobody can fully tell the two apart, but I like the heuristic as a means of finding the destined way.

Been a pretty great week reconnecting with the community and documentation work. I had some great interactions with Emir in the Discord, which makes me happy because he connects to a whole other side of the network. And the docs just kept chugging along all week.

Monday night and into Tuesday morning was the last crazy grind I plan en toto, whereby I reached out to Johan and Webb via Don too. Haven't seen anything back from them yet, but generally I love that everyone's taking their time reviewing TAR1. Even Josh Hamilton has been pondering on some feedback, which honestly I just can't wait to mature.

Everyone seems to be taking a holiday circa this weekend according to some private mastermind plotting on Wednesday. Lol no postcase, so we just had a great time hopping into VC. I'm glad everyone is so synchronized along personal sentiments, and I'm liking this weekly reflection form as a way to really keep goodness in focus.

Thursday had some excellent DRS discussions as we planned out the world changing. Everyone's really excited to implement DUNA governance and make the DAO win. Even enjoyed a conversation with new friend Drew about their background which worked out into a great back and forth about their journey into the stonk and a beautiful oceanic career.

On Friday, K and I made some great progress on asset management, and I moved funds around to help her invest more. I'm glad we had so much to start with and a solid base to grow together. I also got to write a thoughtful note to K that day, outlining some exciting work I get to bring across the finish line in the coming months. <3

16 has entered my rhetoric of TA numbers as the start of something great, and that's what I experienced yesterday while running oil change and grocery errands. After this, I got to walk through a beautiful forest, feeling the incredible paths of a train around a natural sanctuary. It had a live train run by a gorgeous pond, and I'll never forget those freight cars glimmering off the water surface.

Really appreciate the beauty of nature, which I saw unfold through God when staying up to make cookies after Kayla's long day at work. Before then, it was so incredible to hear her flute song, reminiscing over past days in band. And she really appreciated me running errands while she rested up after that short time out.

We also got to play two whole games of Mario Party this weekend, conjoined with some fun movies like Mario Bros and Winnie the Pooh. Lol she was so into everything and had the head to prove it! Lol also she just came in here and gave me kissies to "give me a pick-me-up" for motivation.

She's so sweet, and I saw that today when reviewing some old docs laying around the kitchen and living room. The first thing is her written plan for our anniversary, which was that magic day after TAR1 when we took the train to Metamora. It was a very close experience with my subconscious throughout that healing ride, and I loved the scenery cradling us together. The back of that was her awesome plan for my birthday, leading up to the special dinner we had together. She really went all out to make everything perfect and special for me :)

On the next page, she even proves the whole thing out to be a responsible baby, noting the travel time and operating hours. When she has the ideas, I just can't believe how well she executes on them, completely to my personal deference. Since I used to see her as an embodiment of the universe, I suppose she's now an embodiment of God—which really makes me want to follow good old Catholic values shared 🤝

And then on the back of that was the awesome confetti cake she made for my birthday. It lays out the magical frosting and dough recipes, completed with splendid baking instructions. I really appreciate her dedication to suiting my wants and aspirations across living aspects.

Lastly, I found an old postcard note from when Mom took us to the Spice and Tea Exchange. It's a cocktail recipe using the special matcha and chile oil Kayla implements so well in delicious Asian meals. She just made me a pasta with seasonings and an egg that was to die for@!

I feel complete in every sense of the word on the inside. I'm so thankful for this massive fulfillment and loving community constantly supporting us in an endeavor to my goal objective. Building real savings and retirements for masses of people has always been my guiding light, no matter how cheesy it sounds, and I just deeply appreciate the nuanced perspective these last few years gave me on how most live so separated from the replies and income of the market, something I can't wait to globally remedy through a path I'd never imagined years ago.
