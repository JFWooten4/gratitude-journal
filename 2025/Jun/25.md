Man, only ten days but you could really make me feel otherwise. My brain might as well not have reflected in four years. Holy man this has been just such an insane period of personal growth.

I remember the early days, everyone saying you needed mentors and professionals to walk you through life. But man, I've found exceptional guidance and solace in fiction backed by significant investment. This last week, the big hooks for me came from K recommendations, which I even repeated in twice consumptions.

They were the Netflix K-pop Demon Hunters and Frozen Theatrical recording. The former was actually insane in showing the meaningfulness of this new path down the route of public speaking principally, followed on by policy. The latter really captured how I feel in the reimagined "Let It Go" event horizon.

This was all complimented by a weekend extravaganza with what could be my last time going so deep into the dark side. I made a good connection in another exchange with Autumn, which is pretty sweet. Or at least, that's the current name DJTOb3 Toby guy (girl?!) is going by now.

Lately I've been coming to beauty with the whole marriage thing, and it's had me reflecting on the difference between the dark and light sentiments of art. Art, and meaningfully work inspirations.

Mom came last Friday to Sunday, and she asked me what got me excited about my efforts in the drive over here after I picked her up in Indy. I told her about how much I couldn't wait to prove all these DTC assholes wrong, how they were just doing such horrible things. Before she asked the question, I was on the verge of falling asleep driving after a light lunch of only salad and soup (which was really awesome at the museum cafe!!!), but afterwards I was full of life for the entire ride home, as if I had this newfound vitality.

That's most definitely a form of what would be traditionally considered Sith, which I hesitate to even write in here. But it came up in the demon movie when they intentionally write their first mean song, only for the main enlightened character to recognize that it simply doesn't bring people together to use anything other than hope. Chives and I are struggling to figure out how to frame everything in terms of hope, and sadly as I write this the only thing I think of would be a recovery from crisis.

### Last Week

Started off on the mid-point of the SEC review, where the DRS community really stepped up Monday night. I gave Chives a call in the morning and he really helped calm me down after a pretty insane weekend. I really wonder if all these deadlines will give them a chance to vote on things before Pierce leaves office. It gets me excited.

I'd say that's been my daily theme since that night of collaboration. Chives wrote most of the content, albeit some small copy-edits from LRF. It was unbelievably refreshing to be able to breeze through something like this together. It's been years since anyone ever worked collaboratively to this extent.

Lol, everyone was so frickin happy by the end of that night. It was really something special. And man did I really appreciate all their efforts.

U guys are awesome. Days like that give me the confidence needed in retroactive consideration. And man I just can't wait to share the compensation we're all waiting for.

## Tuesday+

After that, I got the final items configured for the upcoming trip to Grandma and Grandpa's house. I'm so thankful for this opportunity to break away and relax for a little bit. I need this so much and really so stoked to have days away from all this.

I also worked on the last response item, putting the docs together for the terminus review 2 narrative. Reached out and got the Stellar community ancillary involved, which was cool to connect with. Also getting the block explorer docs together.

Next couple days were just getting that done. I was up for a lot of nights, because I needed to get it done before picking up Mom. Originally thought Thurs night, but went into 4 a.m. the Friday with a silly white text on the final submission. I'm thankful I can keep looking forward and accept past publications as they needed to be.

My old agenda makes a record of a trading oath on the last day, which was fulfilled yesterday. In this context, I think it was for something retroactive, where I was noticing an internal change and marking it for brevity in an intense timeframe. It was really here that I realized the importance of singular focus on make-or-break times.

## Mom Visit

After all that, it was awesome to have some days worry-free with Mom in town, just having fun together. I couldn't think of a better way to celebrate the great times we had finishing up that work. And man did we have a blast!

The first day, I took her to the IN State Museum. We saw some really cool and fun history, playing together as if we were early pioneering settlers. Then there was a pop culture section from when Mom was growing up, and she absolutely loved that! :)

One of my favorite parts was going through the ancient dinosaur and creature sections. We saw incredible beasts from way before our time, lamenting at their grace together. And Mom really enjoyed the ginormous bugs we poked fun at together.

After, we had our peaceful lunch together and went right back into the fray. Mom loved the art section on the top floor, snapping some great photos of all the paintings. And I couldn't get beyond the incredible time-sphering thing which balanced against the whole building.

After the museum, we walked out back along the old canal. We rented a swan boat together and lol we paddled together, having a complete and total blast. She was skeptical at first, but it turned out to be an amazing adventure to say the least.

So thankful for the great history. The incredible views were just something else. And what a setup for an incredible ride back home via the candle store.

Mom loved the candle store, after a next-door pitstop to get some coffee. She was so enthralled by all the locale! And kind enough to get us some cups and candles which we are super enjoying!!

Next day on Saturday, we went through K's awesome day. She planned so many fun things, starting with the farmers market. After that, we went to the local produce farm store.

I really appreciate all her work putting that day together. We got to go pick lavender at the family farm next, and we had an awesome time out there together. Also a great lunch stop at the Old Rooste. Mom was so sweet and entertained as we ate together.

That was also the mantra at dinner, where we dressed up and traversed to Jonesey's. We loved the fire and food together! :) What a magical night.

Hahaha I remember the first night we were together, starting to watch Logan's Run together. We'd just gotten back from the nice hole-in-the-wall historic bar in Richmond downtown. K and Mom put me to sleep with their chemistry talk!

Love them both so much. And had a blast finishing up with breakfast all together on Sunday. Then K and I went to the mall for some of her favorite shopping.

Also had a nice brunch at Bonefish, which was more romantic than expected! Nice and secluded there and at Costco, stocking up on the way home. And of course Mom was so sweet as to help us get the part to fix the washer/dryer heating <3

It was really nice, but I'm getting quite tired now. That Sunday was a pretty momentous peace we had, completely away from work. It's nice to think I might get another spurt off relatively soon.

Since then, been cleaning up the house and getting everything in order after relative discovery chaos. Lol, sometimes I feel like Discord on the most extremes, but I understand that's the universe guiding me towards what's right.
