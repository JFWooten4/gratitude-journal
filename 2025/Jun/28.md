These last three days have been pretty awesome because the public goods fund finally came out. They've got to be close to releasing the NQG stack, which just gets me super excited. Now is the time to finish my documentation spree, so that everyone will be super happy with me :)

I'm really thankful for everything this last year brought us. Kayla just went to the bank and deposited the year's rent. So thankful for her amazing work taking responsibility over some more mundane things as work starts heating up.

I'm really thankful we have each other, and the darker exploring these last couple months has particularly brought that up to light for me. After some of the most extreme working days, I've been walking the park field track out back with some intense music fueling me up all night. It's really helped me connect with the full breadth of my personality.

I've come to really appreciate the nuance of Star Wars' emotional nuance. The real balance of a good and bad self, however, can stem from decisions made rightly with an understanding of the dark counterparts relevant. As Isaac Newton said, every action has its equal and opposite reaction (sic), and the same can be said about reality itself.

I remember the nights walking out there during the final moments of the TAR1 comment (less so given caffeine) and SEC review letters (especially when working alone). One particular night, I passed one of the play-toy metal statues which I've dubbed a reminder of DTC. That's when Villain came on, a new banger by BGM  eeeeeee.

I just know that there's a force out there brewing to embrace what we've built. That my greatness will come alongside an equivalent foe. And that our battles of legalese will be the most damn fun I ever have yet!

I'm looking forward to all that. And I'm glad for the more extreme MLP art that's helped me understand it. Just got through much of Tamer12345's content and have sincerely enjoyed the hell out of it laughing hysterically.

Also got through an awesome day today with Kayla's coworker's daughter's local birthday party. Things are going well with her femininely, and it was nice to get out with her friends and see some local fun. It was a pizza party (I obliged briefly!) and it was nice to see some of the locals and small children.

Reminded me of how different I am from so many, which is why I appreciate the people I "love" (for lack of a better word) online. I just would be bored as hell out of my mind if I had only these to speak with. And that's totally fine, great people living great lives, but man just not intellectually stimulating when your politicking skills get so high that you can predict most avenues of routine conversations.

I think things are finally going to slow down. I got that list pretty much complete for Kayla. And I'm happy to start wrapping things with bows before getting outta town xoxo.
