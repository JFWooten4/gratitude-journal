I think K was right about how the real world has lots of people I get to talk to. This has been an action-packed week with a standout NY review meeting where staff got their first looks at the blockchain deployment. I think our next follow-ups are the cusp of a whole new market paradigm.

It's also been a week with massive growth and internal activity. A lot of mental expansion which has been an insane journey. Today I went through a bunch of old photos with both of us together and just started bawling. I'm so happy we have each other and our love in so many ways.

It was also the first time I've been to church since Italy two years ago. I appreciated the reinforcing messages that mimic the incredible world around me. I'm so very thankful for this opportunity to bring forth our important message.

Aside from that, it's been a lot of reminiscing over the trip. That and our day yesterday watching lots of anime and movies. Rediscovering a lot of requisite motivation to take some dominance with the Commission as we are the first introducing a new TAD.

I keep trying to make everything perfect, but with the deadlines approaching I'll be getting it all in one way or another. I didn't realize how it felt to output so much in such short timeframes. And so maybe that's what typical "real-world" schedules and discussions look like.

K always so clever, even when by accident. I loved the easier days we had in less busy times, going out to magical local destinations together. These crazy markets lately give me the motivation to do anything to bring those good times to the present once again.
