My mind is just exploding right now. I think part of it's from running out of food today, turning me to the greased sugary snacks from K. I'm very thankful for my stern dedication to health and nuanced understanding of what is or isn't poison.

As the years go by, I find myself very thankful for the incredible friendships we've made—we being myself and God lol. His plan is all really coming together now, and I appreciate the opportunity to serve as His vessel. I might still have a smidge of centralization left in me, but I promise we'll turn out a stellar product _with or without proper fuel!_

Lol but in all seriousness, I'm going to start buying more groceries and eating a proper diet relatively soon. Whether or not I can afford to go full keto depends on certain review statuses. I really hope I can in the immediate future, and I'm happy to dedicate my assets towards the cause.

In other news, the Commission reached back out regarding the NY office examination tonight/afternoon. Pretty darn cool to get their rigor applied to my own submissions. Damn I love working with these guys. 💜

Since nobody really took me seriously before, it's an incredible breath of fresh air to finally have someone that both _cares_ and _understands the nuance_ of the laws completely! Or at least, I'm speaking with a representative of a massive team which I greatly implicated thereto. Some crazy shit going on with Congress potentially banning FINRA, and this kind of Commission care as public servants is exactly what the investing public needs more than anything.

I've appreciated the femininity implicit in their response, a trait which I really was not expecting when it comes to their rulemaking. Or at least, this outreach into what is an investigation. Like, damn, wtf how cool is it that real people are finally looking over my work.

It's an incredible feeling. And all this doesn't even get into the immaculate vacation K and I had this weekend. I've got to think they knew about the travel times here from the FBI. I really appreciate their timing of response to my returning to the States. Damn they are just so cool. 🧠

Lol, I've never done a trifecta before in a reflection like this, but I'm just so fucking tired lol!!! I still need to make a protein shake for the week and get my eyes closed. Lol I even get to fix up the literal entire bathroom travel circumstances.

I promise I'll touch on the trip in due time. For now, I just thank the Lord for giving me this super meaningful chance to take a break and uncover meaningful internal principles before being thrust back into the fire. I can't wait to ship it 🚀
