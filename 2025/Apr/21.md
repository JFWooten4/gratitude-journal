Im n reizing thatI   can cllapse theirr whole house  of cards by just focusing n the oCC as the single entity  to fail, since it cogeals ito everyoen else througgh the cross-margiing agreement. It really  is somewhat insane how inteconnected they've intentionally made everythnig, with the permisssion and over--perview of the regulators. All so that  there is iterally  aserro alternatie t resucuing their system after they've taken evveerythig frm the hands so near the money-printer.

I sue hoe peolpe fully understandd what happened here when thisii all over. It's a case stufdy  on greed tat humaity can't repeat. And frnkaly they aren't even humanity  anymore, its just these select few wo fi temsels so ardamentloy  ontrollign a society graspig or its reedom iei.

lol rerthe the Andor attac episodde frm S1 today in prep for S2 tomow. It's the start o  rel-life revolution here and now.  Everythin wee ben woriig u towada thee years, and mn I;m like that bossirl n that I jus need to press the bbutton and coll the shot to eegin executio.

It'll b very quuick twen things start moving ere soon, ad i f like it'll be like her  contantly checking te preplanied stoopwatch of how long they ave until the fighterrs deploy. but nbody ese will hae that inteal cclocck, ecuae nbody else kowss the depth Ii UDERSTAND. And ofc the  trading background is really ecessary  to timee everything properly against market sentiments.

I wonder , looking back, if they'll say BT came out of "the crash". Wil future historias see this as our moment of ""going to market," even thouggh it's litrally  the ame shsit Ive been working on for years? WWel,  al i kno is itll b fun a ell.

I cannot wait t see it all burn down. To sit i nthe onngressional testijmony and watch y  words wipe thhe smies right fff their faces. ou gie me  camera feed add I;ll moe the natin to a sustaial financial systmme. ðŸ’œ
