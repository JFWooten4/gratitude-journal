Good week of work! I feel a whole lot better now that i am writing and trading more. It's certainly a different kind of trading, with my attention.. social capital, and sparce donations.

I hope the donations grow with time, and it'll be interesting I think to see how that all progresses. The epxerince with Cats in particular has been quite interesting ormme, seeing what htey do on their own even though I super want to pay and help them. Cannto wait to se the impact some funding support has with them.

Week started ou strong, and we learned that it would be a funll fun one since ny was too cold for A.P. - but she;s getting healthier now! :) Love Aunt Patty and so hapyp to speal with her and mom and chrisotpher and grandma and grandpa lambert and dad today for a happy easter yayness! They are all so fun and ecciting family to be around, adn I usper papreciate everything we have together.

After working on TAR and catching up with the regulatory changes, the week hit pretty well. Atkins is in office and I;m really getting the background work done with Perice. They seem t be she shot callers to focus on right now.

K has been a big inspiration for all that, helping me find the motivation to keep working hard via her memory. Started going to bed early in observance of trying to get more progress on everything using m prime intimate personal reflecion and writing skills. Get to chat wiht Ankit even tommorow

That rounded me through the rest of the week getting things going. I need to finish up all the final doc sourcing prep this week with the allegaged maical collateral meeting. And hten we are getting it together and submitted ti the community the week of Chirstopher's graduation.

So excted to f inally get things together in a completed working product. Moingit to my monthyl top priority over getting the docs handled in any regard fo Stellar, because the omcplaicne work comes bfore the preperatirty advance work.
