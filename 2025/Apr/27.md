Okay, not so much a whole week, but man has quite a lot happened since Wednesday! That was the day of the Great Collateral Experiment by the DTCC. Given the high-level legal institute propaganda against Webb's work, I frankly can't believe how brazenly they've titled this declaration to the industry (almost like a take it or die option chain).

So thankful to that guy all those years ago who shared the true nature of this through a simple support ticket. What an amazing person who the universe so fortuitously brought upon myself. Definitely been a lonesome journey as sort of the sole insider here, but one that I certainly wouldn't trade for a dispersed information flow from a hierarchical org.

It's all in my own hands, and that's just an exceptional feeling. One that I've unbelievably enjoyed these last few days. They were so full of love and fun <3

Aside from getting to finish a ton of awesome researching and writing work, I've seen the fruits of other community members' efforts sprout into magnificence just at the tail of last week. And so many new incredible people I'm very thankful for, coming out of the woodwinds.

K has been great throughout all this, keeping me just enough on my ties to make everything work great. I really appreciated her this week, which was full of delicious noodle-shrimp with nut sauces :)

And then yesterday she made me the most incredible fruit tea for breakfast, from the pack Mom got me for Christmas. <3 She was also super sweet, sending over a special Caroline Cake and a surprise mystery. Calling and sending her love her special way.

Anyway, that drink was just the start of the day as we drove all the way to the Indianapolis Zoo which was awesome! We got the tickets set up at home together, and that meant we were straight into the gorgeous gardens. Oh such a beautiful start of a zoo with an indoor butterfly lounge stuffed with tropic plants — and even a few fishies!

Then we saw all the animals under the sun, a pack of apes, and the most beautiful dolphin show. I even got a couple pictures next to the apes thanks to K!

Then, after the scar-white crocodiles!!, we got to ride a full-on narrow-gauge train! I was so thankful for that incredible experience circling the natural world. Then we were off throughout the rest of the zoo — K loved the flamingos and walk-through bird cages.

She was so sweet there and at the Indianapolis 500 museum! We got to see hundreds of cars from the earliest to most modern years — all racing fast long after their sporting victories. Was so inspiring to see the others who'd give it all for a fleeting shot at performance.

That was fun, and not to be outtopped by the incredible Brazilian steakhouse we enjoyed together after! They were super fancy and had everything I could imagine and more! Yum yum, we feasted ourselves away for just the most magical moment together there.

After all the feasting we walked together by a lake. It was a nice romantic night ended with relaxation as we spun down our full day of activities. And I really found some peace to think to myself about the nature of all to come.

Today was a little more involved with watching Freakonomics, Monsters Inc., and the Cowboy Bebop Movie all day long. Learning things, enjoying myself, and finding some fun with K. She was cute sleeping in until we got up to make our snacks for the park. Also got to taste a little of her yummy cake batter. Once it was baked to the core, we went out for a noodle-soup picnic. It was very relaxing, and followed by a greatly entertaining and loving walk around the park together. K loved the cats, horses, and reminiscent festival; while I was more enticed by the disc golf and pastures.

Appreciated the tranquil maturity I felt there, having freshly discovered abundant restraint at the zoo. A slightly more developed perspective where everything is in abundance and possible, but there are still deferences given to your own resources. A choice to do what you'd like knowing all options are just fine.

One place that really showed it was when kids were feeding carrots to giraffes at the zoo, but I was more interested in the zebras and keeping my hands clean for K. We appreciated the opportunity but moved on to the next incredible sights. I really appreciate the autonomy I get to enjoy living out here with her.

It empowers me so gingerly to fully express my positions and feelings at work in a way I just know will make a difference for everyone. Oh and what great times we had enjoying that strawberry-frosted keto birthday cake together — just delicious. So fun to watch her enjoy herself and feel her climaxing.
