Great few days as the week starts up with the community really thriving. So thankful for all of Chives' recent work and the unique role I get to fill bringing Webb to the masses, protecting everyone. Last night finished out with reviewing the crypto task force regulations which seem like very promising moments for our influence.

Got to go to dinner with Dad today, walking around downtown Indianapolis. Super fun scenery with the state capitol and war statue from hundreds of years ago! Also enjoyed walking through the downtown shops, all incredibly organized around great buildings.

Steakhouse dinner was fun, and we got a special crème brûlée for K out the door. She was so happy and loved it. And I was so grateful when Dad offered to let me stay with him at the downtown hotel.

K has been so awesome helping with rent so that I can do silly things as I trade towards my future. Appreciate the time together which I enjoyed with audiobooks. I'm really getting all audiobook-ed out with my own understanding surpassing the basic content and primitives. Just want to put it into action and perform my own specialized action!
