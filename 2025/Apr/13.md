Man what a material last almost week! Firstly off, the Wednesday discussions in the DRS community were super hot. I'm really glad I can get the voice in now, because it's literally super draining when I'm into it.

Oftentimes I wonder what the community will be like when I'm not there anymore. If the meetings would still even happen if a lot of the times it's just Chives and me. I'm glad we get to have a feature from Nyte this week, full stop.

In the future, hopefully more incredible individuals like that emerge. God that would be cool. Because frankly the best thing I can do for everyone is writing down how things work and allocating capital to superstars.

Man I'm so excited for us to have some newfound capital to throw around now that donations are set up. I've never run an org with other peoples' money before, so this will be my first chance allocating community funds to collective labor. I'd be lying if I didn't say that gets me pretty stoked.

All the TAR setup work finished on Thursday after Atkins was sworn in. The clock is ticking, and I can't wait to get the agenda in front of him. If I'm lucky, we'll see some headlines this week or next discussing his work with DOGE.

Friday was a stellar reflection day up until I ran out of food. Then I got to snack and watch movies lol! In all seriousness, it was a fun night where I stayed up way too late watching Senku in the bed with K, which was nice in its own way.

Then on Saturday we got to explore the local bridge antiquities before getting a special sushi dinner. Afterwards, we went to the local bowling alley over there.

K was so happy to get her special roll, and she even took an extra for the ride home! Less thrilled about bowling at first, but she did really well and had a great time! So cool to see her smile after a strike or two. And she made me just the best to-go tea which we brought, mixed with almond milk - yum!

Today we got to sit in the bed together all day while I read and wrote. Nice relaxing together and playing games. She was open about how it'd be nice for me to have money things, which I appreciated, and hopefully this will help with that.

Trying everything and going as hard as I can. But I just thankfully will not sacrifice what I know is right to get this done quicker. Sharpening the axe...
