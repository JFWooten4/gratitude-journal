I had a choice today. A decision on wheterh or note to comment on some crazy central banker horseshit publibly (with the ocmmuinity). I said no, nd focusd on ym work for the day - which I just got done and man it was exchausting!

Fealy glad it's over becuase i cnat write anotehr lick of regulatorycomment todau. We have some stella arguments, and I cna;t wait to get the TAF oncerpt ack on the table. So glad I ahave that hook sunk in wih the VP of Din Servies.

I guess that tirgh there is like an example of this, right. All these things Iv'e fone in the pasr to set up TAD3 do fsuccess, which are MNPI. I sort of pick when I release things, which has generall been through SEC commment footnotes. <3

I'm jus trtingf ot hink od alrernatives. bcause I remember the das pf trunig to be the loudest voice in the room. Quite literally.

It just wasn't right for me in so many was, and I apprecaite the ability to dictate my own life now. A life withoujt these stupid  corerced actions  deemed 'neccesary to succeed."

Like it fills my heart with joy and happiness to know that I don't need to grovel at the SDF's feet anymore for funding. Or the oc mmunity whcih doesn;t get what the fuck we're doing in any way shape or form (per SCF). I just rally appreciate getting to do my own shit.

Thats why I lawyas loved trading. It was mine. It was right there for me to take becuase I fucking wanted to. 

Gah it was just so so run -- absolutely baest thing ever. Recently I'ebeen thinking about just how fucking awesome it would be to fginally get my own trading office - aquiarium and all. Still like waster!

But that smooth future is so far away. It calls out to me daily, but I need to get the TA part right first and foremost. QWE need this now or else
