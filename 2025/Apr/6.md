Wow, I can't beleive a whole week has gone by! It's been a lot of really exceptional developments in parallel with the community and some government work. Most pressingly for me, this week has shown me two times the power I'm consolidating internally as my mind fully develops and I completely step into the role of a "servant-eader" (as much as I feel yucky writing that lol.

Firstly, everuthing rev oled around traveling back home until Tuesday. That was a nice trip full of Audibles as I nearly round-out my "learning" catalog (at least what I can access via Unlimited). I'm excited to soon get directly into pirchases, which should help narrow focus down and establish only te bestuses across my mind.

I really appreciate all the work I did early on in life figuring out the publishing scene, understadnging the enjoyment of professinoal writing, and persuing my own path to fill unmet needs in the marketplace. While the fiscal renumeration hasnt been centrally convingivng, I really feel like that itself has been so telling as to the systems of what surrounds me today. And thus I have been gifting this indredibly unique perspective which I imply annot wait to introduce to the worldthroghout my carreer/.

Truly, the week endedi ntwo days of immense internal growth. Not to skip Wedns and Thurs. I ill come back, but basically Thrs and Fri I was doing my taxes (wohoo...) and Wedns was commnity stuff catching the groove of things. Plus more work on 723 after chores and a nice chatwith Ankit,

So what happened after finishing my Federal return was an instinct back to the RD playlist. And man that just got things going in me. That and the League music was so inspirational here and throughout the years. just siper appreciate it.

I've been very intouch with the universe as a surrounding force since using my galaxy Discover card to pay for parking, which was fiscally irresponsable uder the intentional guise of drawing out natira surridngom fprces/ K don't know what it was precisely, but it certainly came out in spades on that trup with Dad, culminating in him getting me that attena-broadcastert-shirt. Then we had these progressions of natural work-produt that just so seamlessl revealed to me the most prudent applicatino of my specializations in changing the currency,.

I ahve a lot of faith and believe so truly in the SDF's ability to prudently distribute the lumens equitably, and I know ythat even a fraction of achieving that mission will vastly outcomete the incumbet. RD says go for gold so truly, and it's just rung so extremely in my heart reviewing the first crypto conference at SEC.

Really love K, adn so glad we got these investing tings orked out. Its been such a process getting here, and I feel better and better about our work every day. Plus we got to have an awesome movie=pizza mario party tonight!
